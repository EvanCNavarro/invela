3. Document Processing Service 🔄 (Current Implementation)
   - Processing State Transition (Next Step)
     - Fix initial state when moving to processing step
     - Ensure files retain IDs and correct status
     - Add console logging to verify state preservation
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [DocumentUploadWizard] Moving to processing step with files:
       {fileIds: [], statuses: [], timestamp}
       [DocumentProcessingStep] Received files for processing:
       {fileCount, fileDetails: [{id, status}], timestamp}
       ```

   - Processing Queue Activation
     - Implement proper queue start on component mount
     - Handle card fields loading state correctly
     - Add verification logs for queue initialization:
       ```
       [DocumentProcessingStep] Queue initialized:
       {pendingFiles: [], processingFile: null, timestamp}
       [DocumentProcessingStep] Starting first file:
       {fileId, status: 'processing', timestamp}
       ```

   - PDF Processing Implementation
     - Implement PDF chunking
     - Create processing queue
     - Handle processing state updates
     - Add logging for chunk processing:
       ```
       [DocumentProcessing] Starting chunk processing:
       {fileId, chunkIndex, totalChunks, timestamp}
       [DocumentProcessing] Chunk processed:
       {fileId, chunkIndex, answersFound, timestamp}
       ```

   - WebSocket Integration
     - Real-time status updates
     - Progress tracking
     - Error handling
     - Required logs:
       ```
       [WebSocket] Processing update:
       {fileId, progress, status, timestamp}
       [WebSocket] Error encountered:
       {fileId, error, timestamp}
       ```

   - OpenAI Integration
     - Document analysis
     - Answer extraction
     - Confidence scoring
     - Verification logs:
       ```
       [OpenAI] Starting analysis:
       {fileId, chunkIndex, inputLength, timestamp}
       [OpenAI] Analysis complete:
       {fileId, answersFound, confidence, timestamp}
       ```

4. Processing Time Management:
   - Calculate initial estimated processing time
   - Dynamic updates based on actual processing speed
   - Real-time remaining time display
   - Progress indicators per document

5. Answer Aggregation System:
   - Combine answers across documents:
     - Eliminate duplicate answers
     - Maintain source attribution
   - Clear presentation in UI:
     - Group by question
     - Show source documents
     - Display confidence scores

## Logging Guidelines 📝
- Every new feature must include detailed console logging
- Logs should include:
  - Component/service name as prefix
  - Action being performed
  - Relevant state/data as JSON
  - Timestamp
- Log format: `[ComponentName] Action description: {data, timestamp}`
- Critical points to log:
  - Component mounting/initialization
  - State transitions
  - API calls start/completion
  - Error conditions
  - WebSocket events
  - Processing status changes

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99% ✅
- Classification accuracy > 95% ✅
- Real-time updates < 500ms ✅
- Support for files up to 50MB ✅

### Processing Success Metrics
- Document state persistence across sessions ✅
- < 2s response time for document analysis
- > 90% accuracy in card task validation
- Clear source attribution for all answers
- Efficient chunking with no token limit errors

## Verification Process
1. Check console logs for each component initialization
2. Verify state transitions through logged data
3. Confirm processing queue behavior through logs
4. Validate WebSocket updates in real-time
5. Monitor PDF processing chunks and OpenAI responses
