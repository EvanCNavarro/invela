# Implementation Plan: Enhanced File Upload System with Document Classification

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the file upload system with:
1. Automated document classification using OpenAI âœ…
2. Real-time document count tracking per category âœ…
3. Improved file size handling (50MB limit) âœ…
4. Enhanced file type validation âœ…
5. Better error handling and user feedback âœ…

## Completed Steps âœ…

### Phase 1: Database Enhancement
- Added document_category enum type
- Added new fields to files table
- Created document count materialized view
- Added necessary indices for performance

### Phase 2: OpenAI Integration
- Installed and configured OpenAI SDK
- Created document classification service
- Implemented confidence scoring
- Added retry mechanism
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Switched to GPT-3.5-turbo for larger document support âœ…

### Phase 3: File Processing Enhancement
- Implemented efficient PDF processing (first 3 pages only)
- Switched to pdf.js-extract for reliable PDF text extraction âœ…
- Added text length limits for OpenAI compatibility âœ…
- Added file size limit of 50MB
- Improved file type validation
- Added detailed logging

### Initial WebSocket Setup
- Implemented WebSocket server with proper configuration
- Added real-time document count updates
- Added classification status updates
- Implemented connection health monitoring

## In Progress ðŸ”„

### Next Focus: Document Count UI Updates
1. User Interface Enhancements:
   - Show loading toast during file upload/processing
   - Update document count in category boxes after successful classification

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99%
- Classification accuracy > 95%
- Real-time count update latency < 500ms
- Classification time < 2 seconds per document
- Support for files up to 50MB

## Rollback Plan
- Revert to basic file upload if needed
- Disable classification temporarily if API issues occur
- Fall back to manual classification if needed
