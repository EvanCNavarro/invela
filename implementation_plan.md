     - File Name and Size columns ✅
     - Processing Result Context ✅
     - Highlight active processing rows ✅
     - Proper state transitions ✅

2. Critical Fixes ✅
   - File ID Management ✅
     - Fixed mismatch between upload and processing steps
     - Implemented correct database IDs usage
     - Added validation to prevent processing with invalid IDs

   - Sequential Processing ✅
     - Implemented one-at-a-time document processing UI
     - Added proper progress tracking per file
     - Set up processing queue structure

   - Error Handling Enhancement ✅
     - Propagating specific error messages to UI
     - Showing detailed failure reasons
     - Added recovery options for failed processing
     - Implemented retry mechanism

3. Document Processing Service 🔄 (Current Implementation)
   - Processing State Transition (Next Step) 🔄
     - Fix initial state when moving to processing step
       - [x] Ensure files retain IDs 
       - [x] Add file.type property to match step 1 structure
       - [ ] Handle PDF data chunking (TODO - Next Phase)
     - Add console logging to verify state preservation
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [DocumentUploadWizard] Moving to processing step with files:
       {fileIds: [], statuses: [], fileTypes: [], timestamp}
       [DocumentProcessingStep] Received files for processing:
       {fileCount, fileDetails: [{id, status, type}], timestamp}
       ```

   - Processing Queue Activation
     - Implement proper queue start on component mount
     - Handle card fields loading state correctly

   - PDF Processing Implementation (Next Phase)
     - Add PDF chunking strategy
       - Split large PDFs into manageable chunks
       - Track chunk processing progress
       - Merge results from all chunks
     - Handle binary data preservation between steps
     - Add chunk size configuration
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [PDFProcessing] Starting chunking for file:
       {fileId, totalPages, chunkSize, timestamp}
       [PDFProcessing] Chunk processed:
       {fileId, chunkIndex, pagesProcessed, timestamp}
       ```

4. Processing Time Management:
   - Calculate initial estimated processing time
   - Dynamic updates based on actual processing speed
   - Real-time remaining time display
   - Progress indicators per document

5. Answer Aggregation System:
   - Combine answers across documents:
     - Eliminate duplicate answers
     - Maintain source attribution
   - Clear presentation in UI:
     - Group by question
     - Show source documents
     - Display confidence scores

## Logging Guidelines 📝
- Every new feature must include detailed console logging
- Logs should include:
  - Component/service name as prefix
  - Action being performed
  - Relevant state/data as JSON
  - Timestamp
- Log format: `[ComponentName] Action description: {data, timestamp}`
- Critical points to log:
  - Component mounting/initialization
  - State transitions
  - API calls start/completion
  - Error conditions
  - WebSocket events
  - Processing status changes

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99% ✅
- Classification accuracy > 95% ✅
- Real-time updates < 500ms ✅
- Support for files up to 50MB ✅

### Processing Success Metrics
- Document state persistence across sessions ✅
- < 2s response time for document analysis
- > 90% accuracy in card task validation
- Clear source attribution for all answers
- Efficient chunking with no token limit errors

## Verification Process
1. Check console logs for each component initialization
2. Verify state transitions through logged data
3. Confirm processing queue behavior through logs
4. Validate WebSocket updates in real-time
5. Monitor PDF processing chunks and OpenAI responses
