# Implementation Plan

## Completed Features ✅
- Database Enhancement
- OpenAI Integration
- File Processing Enhancement
- Document Count UI
- File State Management ✅
  - Moved file state to parent component
  - Preserved metadata across wizard steps
  - Added file list debugging view
  - Implemented complete file context persistence

### Phase 5: Document State Management ✅
1. File Persistence:
   - Store uploaded files in document wizard state ✅
   - Maintain file list across wizard steps ✅
   - Add file preview/list component ✅

2. Wizard Navigation Enhancement:
   - Save wizard state between steps ✅
   - Enable back navigation with preserved data ✅
   - Add progress indicators for each step ✅

### Phase 6: Document Analysis Integration 🔄 (Current Implementation)

1. File Object Preservation (Current Focus)
   - Fix file object preservation between steps
     - Track file object state transitions
     - Add detailed logging for verification
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [DocumentUploadWizard] File object before transition:
       {id, file: File, status, timestamp}

       [DocumentProcessingStep] File object after transition:
       {id, file: File, status, timestamp}

       [DocumentProcessing] Verifying file object:
       {fileId, isValid: boolean, timestamp}
       ```

2. Document Processing Service
   - Processing State Management
     - Implement sequential file processing
     - Track processing progress
     - Handle chunk aggregation
     - Required logs:
       ```
       [ProcessingQueue] Starting file processing:
       {fileId, status: 'processing', timestamp}

       [ChunkProcessing] Processing chunk:
       {fileId, chunkIndex, totalChunks, timestamp}

       [ChunkProcessing] Chunk complete:
       {fileId, chunkIndex, answersFound, timestamp}
       ```

   - Document Chunking Implementation 🔄 (Current Focus)
     - [x] Define chunking process within existing /api/documents/process endpoint
     - [ ] Implement sequential chunk processing
     - [ ] Add chunk progress tracking
     - [ ] Handle chunk aggregation for answers
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [DocumentProcessing] Starting processing:
       {fileId, status: 'chunking', timestamp}
       [DocumentProcessing] Chunk processed:
       {fileId, chunksProcessed, totalChunks, timestamp}
       [DocumentProcessing] Processing complete:
       {fileId, status: 'processed', answersFound, timestamp}
       ```

   - Processing Queue Management
     - Properly initialize queue on component mount
     - Handle sequential file processing
     - Track individual file progress
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [ProcessingQueue] Queue initialized:
       {pendingFiles: [], processingFile: null}
       [ProcessingQueue] Starting next file:
       {fileId, queuePosition, remainingFiles}
       ```

   - WebSocket Integration
     - Real-time status updates
     - Progress tracking
     - Error handling
     - Required logs:
       ```
       [WebSocket] Processing update:
       {fileId, status, progress}
       [WebSocket] Error:
       {fileId, error}
       ```

## Logging Guidelines 📝
- Every new feature must include detailed console logging
- Logs should include:
  - Component/service name as prefix
  - Action being performed
  - Relevant state/data as JSON
  - Timestamp
- Log format: `[ComponentName] Action description: {data, timestamp}`
- Critical points to log:
  - Component mounting/initialization
  - State transitions
  - API calls start/completion
  - Error conditions
  - WebSocket events
  - Processing status changes

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99% ✅
- Classification accuracy > 95% ✅
- Real-time updates < 500ms ✅
- Support for files up to 50MB ✅

### Processing Success Metrics
- Document state persistence across sessions ✅
- < 2s response time for document analysis
- > 90% accuracy in card task validation
- Clear source attribution for all answers
- Efficient chunking with no token limit errors

## Verification Process
1. Check file object preservation logs
2. Verify file processing sequence
3. Monitor chunk processing progress
4. Validate answer aggregation
5. Check console logs for each component initialization
6. Verify state transitions through logged data
7. Confirm processing queue behavior through logs
8. Validate WebSocket updates in real-time
9. Monitor PDF processing chunks and OpenAI responses
