  - Moved file state to parent component
  - Preserved metadata across wizard steps
  - Added file list debugging view
  - Implemented complete file context persistence

### Phase 5: Document State Management âœ…
1. File Persistence:
   - Store uploaded files in document wizard state âœ…
   - Maintain file list across wizard steps âœ…
   - Add file preview/list component âœ…

2. Wizard Navigation Enhancement:
   - Save wizard state between steps âœ…
   - Enable back navigation with preserved data âœ…
   - Add progress indicators for each step âœ…

### Phase 6: Document Analysis Integration ðŸ”„

1. UI Structure & User Experience âœ…
   - Document Row Layout âœ…
     - Status Icon Implementation âœ…
       - Green circle-check for processed documents
       - Loading spinner for documents currently processing
       - Grey circle-dashed for pending documents
     - File Name and Size columns âœ…
     - Processing Result Context âœ…
       - "(Processing Document...)" for active processing
       - Total count of answers found in green text
       - Empty state for pending documents
     - Highlight active processing rows with blue-tinted background and border âœ…
     - Proper state transitions from upload to processing âœ…

2. Compliance Questions Integration ðŸ”„ (Next Step)
   - Retrieve questions from card_fields:
     - field_key
     - question
     - ai_search_instructions
     - partial_risk_score_max
   - Structure questions by wizard_section
   - Prepare for OpenAI integration

3. Processing Time Management:
   - Calculate initial estimated processing time
   - Dynamic updates based on actual processing speed
   - Real-time remaining time display
   - Progress indicators per document

4. Document Processing Architecture:
   - File Chunking Strategy:
     - PDFs: Extract ~3 pages (~16,000 chars) using pdf.js-extract
     - DOC/DOCX/TXT/CSV: Similar character limit chunking
   - Sequential Processing:
     - Process documents one at a time
     - Update progress indicators per chunk
   - OpenAI Integration

5. Answer Aggregation System:
   - Combine answers across documents:
     - Eliminate duplicate answers
     - Maintain source attribution
   - Clear presentation in UI:
     - Group by question
     - Show source documents
     - Display confidence scores
