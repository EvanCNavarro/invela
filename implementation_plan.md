# Implementation Plan

## Current Phase: Document Analysis Integration ðŸ”„

### 1. Processing Queue Initialization âœ“ (Completed)
#### A. File Object Handling During Wizard Transition âœ“
- [x] Fix file object preservation between wizard steps
  - File data structure unified and consistent
  - File metadata properly tracked
  - Files correctly transitioning between steps
  - Expected logs confirmed

#### B. Queue Setup âœ“
- [x] Initialize processing queue with validated files
  - Queue initialization working correctly
  - File validation before queue setup implemented
  - Sequential processing established
  - Expected logs confirmed

#### C. Card Fields Integration âœ“
- [x] Card fields loaded before queue start
  - Loading state handled properly
  - Card fields structure validated
  - Processing starts only after fields are loaded
  - Expected logs confirmed

### 2. Processing State Management âœ“ (Completed)
- [x] Track file status changes
  - Ensure correct state transitions
  - Maintain "uploaded" status for waiting files
  - Show "processing" only for active file
- [x] Handle sequential processing
- [x] Maintain consistent state

### 3. Document Chunking Implementation ðŸ”„ (Current Focus)
#### A. WebSocket Connection Management âœ“ (Completed)
- [x] Consolidate WebSocket connections
  - Prevent duplicate connections during component lifecycle
  - Implement proper connection cleanup
  - Add connection state tracking
  - Logs confirmed working:
    ```
    [WebSocket] Connection initialized:
    {connectionId, timestamp}

    [WebSocket] Connection closed:
    {connectionId, reason, timestamp}
    ```

#### B. PDF Text Extraction Issues ðŸ”„ (Current Focus)
- [ ] Fix PDF text extraction issues
  - Properly extract text content from PDFs
  - Add validation for extracted content
  - Ensure non-zero chunk sizes
  - Expected logs:
    ```
    [PDF Service] Starting text extraction:
    {filePath, pageCount, timestamp}

    [PDF Service] Content extracted:
    {contentLength, pageCount, timestamp}
    ```

#### C. Chunk Processing Optimization
- [ ] Implement file content chunking
  - Add chunk creation logic
  - Handle different file types (PDF, TXT)
  - Track chunk processing progress
  - Validate chunk content before processing
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI processing
  - Process chunks sequentially
  - Extract answers from chunks
  - Aggregate results across chunks
- Expected logs:
  ```
  [ChunkManager] Created chunks:
  {fileId, totalChunks, chunkSizes}

  [ChunkProcessor] Processing chunk:
  {fileId, chunkIndex, progress}

  [OpenAI] Analyzing chunk:
  {fileId, chunkIndex, answersFound}
  ```

#### D. Future Optimization
- [ ] Implement sophisticated chunk size calculation
  - Consider OpenAI token limits
  - Respect natural document breaks
  - Maintain content coherence
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
- [ ] Enhance context handling between chunks
