# Implementation Plan

## Current Phase: Document Analysis Integration ðŸ”„

### 1. Processing Queue Initialization âœ“ (Completed)
#### A. File Object Handling During Wizard Transition âœ“
- [x] Fix file object preservation between wizard steps
  - File data structure unified and consistent
  - File metadata properly tracked
  - Files correctly transitioning between steps
  - Expected logs confirmed:
    ```
    [DocumentUploadWizard] Moving to next step:
    {files: [{id, name, status}], timestamp}

    [DocumentProcessingStep] Received files:
    {files: [{id, name, status}], timestamp}
    ```

#### B. Queue Setup âœ“
- [x] Initialize processing queue with validated files
  - Queue initialization working correctly
  - File validation before queue setup implemented
  - Sequential processing established
  - Expected logs confirmed:
    ```
    [DocumentProcessingStep] Queue initialized:
    {validFiles, queueLength, fileDetails, timestamp}

    [DocumentProcessingStep] Processing started:
    {fileId, totalChunks, timestamp}
    ```

#### C. Card Fields Integration âœ“
- [x] Card fields loaded before queue start
  - Loading state handled properly
  - Card fields structure validated
  - Processing starts only after fields are loaded
  - Expected logs confirmed:
    ```
    [CardFields] Fields loaded
    [ProcessingQueue] Queue ready
    ```

### 2. Processing State Management âœ“ (Completed)
- [x] Track file status changes
  - Ensure correct state transitions
  - Maintain "uploaded" status for waiting files
  - Show "processing" only for active file
- [x] Handle sequential processing
- [x] Maintain consistent state
- Expected logs:
  ```
  [StateManager] File status update:
  {fileId, oldStatus, newStatus, timestamp}
  ```

### 3. Document Chunking Implementation ðŸ”„ (Current Focus)
#### A. Basic Chunking Implementation
- [ ] Implement file content chunking
  - Add chunk creation logic
  - Handle different file types (PDF, TXT)
  - Track chunk processing progress
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI processing
  - Process chunks sequentially
  - Extract answers from chunks
  - Aggregate results across chunks
- Expected logs:
  ```
  [ChunkManager] Created chunks:
  {fileId, totalChunks, chunkSizes}

  [ChunkProcessor] Processing chunk:
  {fileId, chunkIndex, progress}

  [OpenAI] Analyzing chunk:
  {fileId, chunkIndex, answersFound}
  ```

#### B. Future Optimization
- [ ] Implement sophisticated chunk size calculation
  - Consider OpenAI token limits
  - Respect natural document breaks
  - Maintain content coherence
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
- [ ] Enhance context handling between chunks

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99% âœ“
- Classification accuracy > 95% âœ“
- Real-time updates < 500ms âœ“
- File object preservation 100% âœ“
- Processing queue initialization 100% âœ“
- Queue state management 100% âœ“
- Chunk processing accuracy TBD

## Verification Process
1. Check file object preservation during transitions âœ“
2. Verify queue initialization process âœ“
3. Monitor card fields loading âœ“
4. Track processing state changes âœ“
5. Validate error handling ðŸ”„
6. Verify chunk processing accuracy
7. Test answer aggregation

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic file chunking with OpenAI processing ðŸ”„
2. Add error handling for chunk processing
3. Implement answer aggregation across chunks
4. (Future) Optimize chunk size calculation and natural breaks
