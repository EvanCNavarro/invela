# Implementation Plan: Enhanced File Upload System with Document Classification

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the file upload system with:
1. Automated document classification using OpenAI âœ…
2. Real-time document count tracking per category âœ…
3. Improved file size handling (50MB limit) âœ…
4. Enhanced file type validation âœ…
5. Better error handling and user feedback ðŸ”„

## Completed Steps âœ…

### Phase 1: Database Enhancement
- Added document_category enum type
- Added new fields to files table
- Created document count materialized view
- Added necessary indices for performance

### Phase 2: OpenAI Integration
- Installed and configured OpenAI SDK
- Created document classification service
- Implemented confidence scoring
- Added retry mechanism
- Added comprehensive error handling

### Phase 3: File Processing Enhancement
- Implemented efficient PDF processing (first 3 pages only)
- Added file size limit of 50MB
- Improved file type validation
- Added detailed logging

### Initial WebSocket Setup
- Implemented WebSocket server with proper configuration
- Added real-time document count updates
- Added classification status updates
- Implemented connection health monitoring

## In Progress ðŸ”„

### Current Focus: Document Classification Optimization
1. PDF Processing:
   - Switch to pdf.js-extract for reliable PDF text extraction ðŸ”„
   - Implement text length limits
   - Add fallback for corrupted PDFs

2. Classification Enhancement:
   - Add confidence thresholds
   - Implement retry with smaller text samples
   - Add manual override option

3. Frontend Updates:
   - Show classification progress
   - Display confidence scores
   - Add manual classification option
   - Improve error messages

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99%
- Classification accuracy > 95%
- Real-time count update latency < 500ms
- Classification time < 2 seconds per document
- Support for files up to 50MB

## Rollback Plan
- Revert to basic file upload if needed
- Disable classification temporarily if API issues occur
- Fall back to manual classification if needed
