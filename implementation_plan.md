# Implementation Plan

## Completed Features âœ…
- Database Enhancement
- OpenAI Integration
- File Processing Enhancement
- Document Count UI
- File State Management âœ…
  - Moved file state to parent component
  - Preserved metadata across wizard steps
  - Added file list debugging view
  - Implemented complete file context persistence

### Phase 6: Document Analysis Integration ðŸ”„ (Current Implementation)

1. Processing Queue Initialization ðŸ”„ (Current Focus)
   - Initialize Processing Queue
     - [ ] Add queue initialization when files are ready
     - [ ] Add validation for files before adding to queue
     - [ ] Implement proper file status tracking
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [ProcessingQueue] Initializing queue:
       {files: [{id, name, status}], timestamp}

       [ProcessingQueue] Validated files:
       {validFiles: number, invalidFiles: number, timestamp}

       [ProcessingQueue] Queue ready:
       {queueLength, pendingFiles: [], timestamp}
       ```

   - Card Fields Integration
     - [ ] Ensure card fields are loaded before queue start
     - [ ] Add proper loading state handling
     - [ ] Validate card fields structure
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [CardFields] Loading fields:
       {status: 'loading', timestamp}

       [CardFields] Fields loaded:
       {fieldCount: number, timestamp}

       [CardFields] Starting processing:
       {queueReady: boolean, fieldsReady: boolean, timestamp}
       ```

2. Processing State Management
   - State Transitions
     - [ ] Track file status changes
     - [ ] Handle sequential processing
     - [ ] Maintain consistent state
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [StateManager] File status update:
       {fileId, oldStatus, newStatus, timestamp}

       [StateManager] Processing next file:
       {currentFile, remainingFiles, timestamp}

       [StateManager] Queue complete:
       {processedFiles, totalTime, timestamp}
       ```

3. Document Chunking Implementation
   - PDF Processing
     - [ ] Split PDFs into chunks
     - [ ] Track chunk processing
     - [ ] Aggregate results
     - Expected logs:
       ```
       [DocumentProcessing] Starting chunking:
       {fileId, totalPages, timestamp}

       [DocumentProcessing] Chunk processed:
       {fileId, chunkIndex, progress, timestamp}

       [DocumentProcessing] All chunks complete:
       {fileId, totalChunks, answers, timestamp}
       ```

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99% âœ…
- Classification accuracy > 95% âœ…
- Real-time updates < 500ms âœ…
- Support for files up to 50MB âœ…

### Processing Success Metrics
- Document state persistence across sessions âœ…
- < 2s response time for document analysis
- > 90% accuracy in card task validation
- Clear source attribution for all answers
- Efficient chunking with no token limit errors

## Verification Process
1. Check queue initialization logs
2. Verify file validation process
3. Monitor card fields loading
4. Track processing state transitions
5. Validate chunk processing progress
6. Check final results aggregation
7. Monitor overall processing time
8. Verify error handling
9. Check user feedback integration

## Next Steps
1. Implement queue initialization with proper validation
2. Add card fields loading state management
3. Implement processing state transitions
4. Add chunking and processing implementation
5. Integrate results aggregation
6. Add comprehensive error handling
