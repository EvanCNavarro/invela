# Context & Background

## Current Issue:
- KYB and CARD tasks handle file creation differently.
- CARD has inconsistent error handling during file creation.
- Need a standardized approach for current and future tasks.

## Current Setup:
- **KYB**: Simple file creation with robust error handling.
- **CARD**: Complex processing with multiple steps and fragmented error handling.
- Both create files but with different approaches.

# Detailed Implementation Plan

## 1. Create Shared File Creation Utility (Foundation)

### a. Core Components:
- Standard file creation interface.
- Unified error handling.
- Common response format.
- Flexible metadata structure.

### b. Features:
- File naming convention system.
- Standard success/error responses.
- Logging and monitoring.
- Type safety and validation.

---

## 2. Migrate KYB Task (Validation Phase)

### a. Steps:
- Create parallel implementation using new utility.
- Test thoroughly with existing KYB flows.
- Validate error handling.
- Switch to new implementation.
- Maintain old code temporarily as fallback.

### b. Success Criteria:
- All existing KYB functionality preserved.
- Improved error handling.
- No disruption to user experience.

## 3. Adapt CARD Task (Complex Integration)

### a. Pre-Integration:
- Isolate file creation logic from processing logic.
- Identify touch points for new utility.
- Plan preservation of complex processing.

### b. Integration Steps:
- Implement new file creation while preserving:
  - Risk score calculations.
  - Question-level processing.
  - Company updates.
  - Metadata handling.

### c. Validation:
- Comprehensive testing of all CARD scenarios.
- Verify all additional functionality maintained.
- Confirm error handling improvements.
