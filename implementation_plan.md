# Implementation Plan

## Completed Features âœ…
- Database Enhancement
- OpenAI Integration
- File Processing Enhancement
- Document Count UI
- File State Management âœ…
  - Moved file state to parent component
  - Preserved metadata across wizard steps
  - Added file list debugging view
  - Implemented complete file context persistence

### Phase 5: Document State Management âœ…
1. File Persistence:
   - Store uploaded files in document wizard state âœ…
   - Maintain file list across wizard steps âœ…
   - Add file preview/list component âœ…

2. Wizard Navigation Enhancement:
   - Save wizard state between steps âœ…
   - Enable back navigation with preserved data âœ…
   - Add progress indicators for each step âœ…

### Phase 6: Document Analysis Integration ðŸ”„

1. UI Structure & User Experience âœ…
   - Document Row Layout âœ…
     - Status Icon Implementation âœ…
       - Green circle-check for processed documents
       - Loading spinner for documents currently processing
       - Grey circle-dashed for pending documents
     - File Name and Size columns âœ…
     - Processing Result Context âœ…
       - "(Processing Document...)" for active processing
       - Total count of answers found in green text
       - Empty state for pending documents
     - Highlight active processing rows with blue-tinted background and border âœ…
     - Proper state transitions from upload to processing âœ…

2. Critical Fixes Needed ðŸš¨
   - File ID Management
     - Fix mismatch between upload and processing steps
     - Ensure correct database IDs are used (e.g., 207/208) instead of array indices
     - Add validation to prevent processing with invalid IDs

   - Sequential Processing
     - Implement one-at-a-time document processing
     - Only start next file after current one completes
     - Add proper progress tracking per file
     - Include processing time estimates

   - Error Handling Enhancement
     - Propagate specific error messages to UI
     - Show detailed failure reasons (e.g., "No file found")
     - Add recovery options for failed processing
     - Implement retry mechanism

3. Compliance Questions Integration ðŸ”„
   - OpenAI Integration âœ…
     - Setup OpenAI service
     - Implement answer extraction logic
     - Add detailed logging
   - Document Processing Service
     - Implement PDF chunking
     - Create processing queue
     - Handle processing state updates
   - Structure questions by wizard_section
   - Prepare WebSocket updates

4. Processing Time Management:
   - Calculate initial estimated processing time
   - Dynamic updates based on actual processing speed
   - Real-time remaining time display
   - Progress indicators per document

5. Document Processing Architecture:
   - File Chunking Strategy:
     - PDFs: Extract ~3 pages (~16,000 chars) using pdf.js-extract
     - DOC/DOCX/TXT/CSV: Similar character limit chunking
   - Sequential Processing:
     - Process documents one at a time
     - Update progress indicators per chunk
   - OpenAI Integration

6. Answer Aggregation System:
   - Combine answers across documents:
     - Eliminate duplicate answers
     - Maintain source attribution
   - Clear presentation in UI:
     - Group by question
     - Show source documents
     - Display confidence scores

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99% âœ…
- Classification accuracy > 95% âœ…
- Real-time updates < 500ms âœ…
- Support for files up to 50MB âœ…

### Processing Success Metrics
- Document state persistence across sessions âœ…
- < 2s response time for document analysis
- > 90% accuracy in card task validation
- Clear source attribution for all answers
- Efficient chunking with no token limit errors
