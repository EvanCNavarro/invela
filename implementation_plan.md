# Implementation Plan

## Current Phase: Document Analysis Integration ðŸ”„

### 1. Processing Queue Initialization ðŸ”„ (Current Focus)

#### A. File Object Handling During Wizard Transition
- [ ] Fix file object preservation between wizard steps
  - Ensure proper data structure during step transition
  - Add validation for file metadata
  - Expected logs:
    ```
    [DocumentUploadWizard] Moving to next step:
    {files: [{id, file: File, status}], timestamp}

    [DocumentProcessingStep] Received files:
    {files: [{id, file: File, status}], timestamp}
    ```

#### B. Queue Setup
- [ ] Initialize processing queue with validated files
  - Add queue initialization when files are ready
  - Add file validation before queue setup
  - Expected logs:
    ```
    [ProcessingQueue] Initializing queue:
    {validFiles: [{id, status}], timestamp}

    [ProcessingQueue] Queue ready:
    {queueLength, pendingFiles: [], timestamp}
    ```

#### C. Card Fields Integration
- [ ] Ensure card fields are loaded before queue start
  - Add proper loading state handling
  - Validate card fields structure
  - Expected logs:
    ```
    [CardFields] Loading fields:
    {status: 'loading', timestamp}

    [CardFields] Fields loaded:
    {fieldCount: number, timestamp}
    ```

### 2. Processing State Management (Next Phase)
- Track file status changes
- Handle sequential processing
- Maintain consistent state
- Expected logs:
  ```
  [StateManager] File status update:
  {fileId, oldStatus, newStatus, timestamp}
  ```

### 3. Document Chunking Implementation (Future Phase)
- Split PDFs into chunks
- Track chunk processing
- Aggregate results

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99% âœ…
- Classification accuracy > 95% âœ…
- Real-time updates < 500ms âœ…
- File object preservation 100%
- Processing queue initialization 100%

## Verification Process
1. Check file object preservation during transitions
2. Verify queue initialization process
3. Monitor card fields loading
4. Track processing state changes
5. Validate error handling

## Next Steps
1. Fix file object handling during wizard transition
2. Implement proper queue initialization
3. Add card fields loading state management
