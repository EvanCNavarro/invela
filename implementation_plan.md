# Implementation Plan

## Current Phase: Document Analysis Integration ðŸ”„

### 1. Processing Queue Initialization âœ“ (Completed)

#### A. File Object Handling During Wizard Transition âœ“
- [x] Fix file object preservation between wizard steps
  - File data structure unified and consistent
  - File metadata properly tracked
  - Files correctly transitioning between steps
  - Expected logs confirmed:
    ```
    [DocumentUploadWizard] Moving to next step:
    {files: [{id, name, status}], timestamp}

    [DocumentProcessingStep] Received files:
    {files: [{id, name, status}], timestamp}
    ```

#### B. Queue Setup âœ“
- [x] Initialize processing queue with validated files
  - Queue initialization working correctly
  - File validation before queue setup implemented
  - Sequential processing established
  - Expected logs confirmed:
    ```
    [DocumentProcessingStep] Queue initialized:
    {validFiles, queueLength, fileDetails, timestamp}

    [DocumentProcessingStep] Processing started:
    {fileId, totalChunks, timestamp}
    ```

#### C. Card Fields Integration âœ“
- [x] Card fields loaded before queue start
  - Loading state handled properly
  - Card fields structure validated
  - Processing starts only after fields are loaded
  - Expected logs confirmed:
    ```
    [CardFields] Fields loaded
    [ProcessingQueue] Queue ready
    ```

### 2. Processing State Management ðŸ”„ (Current Focus)
- [ ] Track file status changes
  - Ensure correct state transitions
  - Maintain "uploaded" status for waiting files
  - Show "processing" only for active file
- [ ] Handle sequential processing
- [ ] Maintain consistent state
- Expected logs:
  ```
  [StateManager] File status update:
  {fileId, oldStatus, newStatus, timestamp}
  ```

### 3. Document Chunking Implementation (Future Phase)
- Split PDFs into chunks
- Track chunk processing
- Aggregate results

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99% âœ“
- Classification accuracy > 95% âœ“
- Real-time updates < 500ms âœ“
- File object preservation 100% âœ“
- Processing queue initialization 100% âœ“
- Queue state management 90% (In Progress)

## Verification Process
1. Check file object preservation during transitions âœ“
2. Verify queue initialization process âœ“
3. Monitor card fields loading âœ“
4. Track processing state changes ðŸ”„
5. Validate error handling ðŸ”„

## Next Steps
1. Implement robust state management for processing queue ðŸ”„
2. Add comprehensive error handling for processing failures
3. Implement proper cleanup of processed files
