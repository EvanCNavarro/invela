# üìò KYB Form Field Revisions ‚Äî AI Contextual Guide

## ‚úÖ Purpose

This document provides a structured and annotated reference for understanding updates to the **Know Your Business (KYB)** onboarding form. It is designed specifically for use by an AI agent working on form generation, schema updates, or front-end mapping tasks.

All field definitions, proposed edits, additions, and removals are cataloged in a file named:

**`KYB_Form_Field_Revisions_vFinal.csv`**

---

## üìÑ What This File Contains

This CSV contains a complete view of every KYB field, pulled from the original system and annotated with:

- Action to take (`ADD`, `EDIT`, `DELETE`, `NO CHANGE`)
- Mapping between current and proposed field definitions
- Position in the KYB user flow
- Metadata to drive schema-aware and context-sensitive generation

Each row represents one question or field, showing both what exists and what‚Äôs being proposed.

## üß† Instructions for AI Agent

1. **Use `Field Key (field_key)`** as the unique identifier for each field.
2. Respect the `Action` column to determine what to do:
   - `ADD`: Create a new field using all the metadata provided.
   - `EDIT`: Apply the differences shown in the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù columns.
   - `DELETE`: Exclude the field from the new form but retain it for history.
   - `NO CHANGE`: Field remains as-is, no action required.
3. For fields marked `EDIT`, prioritize the value in `New Question Proposal` over the old.
4. Use `New Order Proposal` and `New Group Proposal` to determine **sequence and section placement**.
5. Ensure that field types and required flags are preserved.
6. Ignore timestamp metadata unless explicitly required.
