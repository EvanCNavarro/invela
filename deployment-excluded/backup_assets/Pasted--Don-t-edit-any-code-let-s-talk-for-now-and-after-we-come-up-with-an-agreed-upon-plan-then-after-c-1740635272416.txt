{Don't edit any code, let's talk for now, and after we come up with an agreed upon plan then after confirmation, you can continue with the work.}

I want to add functionality that:

1. allows a user to submit the assessment when the progress is above 10%; so it will unlock and then we need to add functinoality that does the following:
- when the user clicks submit, when all of the fields haven't been filled out the system goes through and creates responses in the database for the user for all of the missing fields, in order, until the end is reached
(Since we're manually editing data, the openai analysis search function shouldn't apply to these)
- - The response value for these system created responses will be "Unanswered."
- - The suspicion level for these system created responses will be "100" (100%)
- - the partial risk score for these system created responses will be the partial risk score max
- - the status will be set to complete
- - the version will increase as per normal
- - the created at and updated at will update per normal
- - the ai reasoning will be "System Reasoning: User did not answer; Maximum Partial Risk Score applied to this form field response."
; Since this might take some time, we need to show a small invela logo loading spinner in the button while it's performing the functionality (until a modal appears)
- the status will then skip from in progress to submitted

2. when the assessment is submitted i want the same gamification style modal (and same confetti animation) to trigger

3. this submission should unlock the dashboard tab and the insights tab; by adding the dashboard and insights tabs to the available_tabs to the company

4. the modal buttons will be (back to task center) [left] and (View insights) [right]

5. the modal text will be similar structure to the kyb form gamification submission modal, but the text will be in relation to the new tabs (Dashboard, Insights).

6. When the user submits the assessment, the company associated should have their onboarding_company_completed set to TRUE

7. when the user submits the assessment, a file should be created (on behalf of the user so that it shows up in their file vault) of the resulting card form data; it should be a .csv of all of the data structured as a combination of data from the card_fields and card_responses tables:
headers: "#" (card_fields.id), "Section" (card_fields.wizard_section), "Question" (card_fields.question), "User Response" (card_responses.response_value).

- when the assessment is submitted the button should change from submit assessment (blue) to (submitted) green; just like the kyb assessment.

- when the assessment is submitted there should be logical that tallies up the sum of all the partial risk score values up to a total risk score. That risk score should then be associated with the company in their companies.risk_score column value.

***
Restructure all these requests into an ordered list that makes sense from a functionality position, so we can test things, and so that you can build and work on these piece by piece rather than all at once.

Once you have the list restructured/reordered, double check the list to see if there's any enhancements that I missed that would make sense in this plan. As well as point out any issue you see in my plans.
