ðŸš§ New Feature Requirements:

You instructed Replit that you want to introduce state management and additional processing on the Document Wizard UI page:
	â€¢	Persist uploaded files across wizard steps:
	â€¢	Move the uploadedFiles state from DocumentUploadStep to the parent DocumentUploadWizard.
	â€¢	Ensure files remain accessible when users navigate between wizard steps.
	â€¢	Enhanced Navigation Flow:
	â€¢	Allow users to see the uploaded files when moving back and forth between steps.
	â€¢	Prevent users from progressing forward if no files are uploaded.
	â€¢	Complex Document Validation:
	â€¢	After files are uploaded, the system will leverage OpenAI (using a chunking strategy previously discussed) to perform a more comprehensive check.
	â€¢	Specifically, documents will be analyzed against provided answers in a card task form, validating if the uploaded files match or satisfy task requirements.

âœ… Replitâ€™s Proposed Implementation Approach (as understood by Replit AI):
	1.	State Management:
	â€¢	Move the uploadedFiles state to a higher-level parent component (DocumentUploadWizard).
	â€¢	Maintain file metadata across wizard steps (classification status, processing state).
	â€¢	Include a persistent file-list component visible throughout wizard navigation.
	2.	Navigation Enhancements:
	â€¢	Ensure file upload state persists when navigating forward and backward through wizard steps.
	â€¢	Block progression until the user uploads at least one document.
	3.	Complex Document-to-Card Validation:
	â€¢	Implement chunk-based text extraction suitable for GPT token limits.
	â€¢	Use OpenAIâ€™s GPT model for detailed validation of uploaded documents against the card task form.
	â€¢	Display validation results clearly on the UI.

âœ… Confirmation of Understanding:

Iâ€™ve processed the details thoroughly and confirm understanding of:
	â€¢	The current implemented state.
	â€¢	Your described conversation and Replitâ€™s understanding and suggestions.
	â€¢	The planned next steps and specific improvements as described.

Youâ€™re all setâ€”ready to proceed as planned!
