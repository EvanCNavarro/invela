      "question": "What is the process for making changes to your software or infrastructure to ensure security?",
      "response": "No.",
      "status": "COMPLETE",
      "riskScore": 15,
      "reasoning": "The user's response 'No' is highly concerning as it indicates a complete lack of a formal process for making changes to software or infrastructure with security considerations. This response lacks any detail on security measures, such as risk assessment, approval processes, or rollback plans, which are critical components of change management in security best practices. The absence of these elements suggests a significant gap in security posture and governance. In comparison, the example response outlines a structured approach that includes formal approval, security risk review, and rollback plans, aligning well with industry best practices. The user's response raises red flags about potential vulnerabilities and a lack of adherence to standard security protocols."

      "fieldKey": "security_security_training",
      "question": "How does your company ensure employees are trained in security best practices?",
      "response": "Our company employs a multi-layered security incident detection and response framework to ensure rapid threat mitigation and compliance with industry standards. We utilize a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDPS), and Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools to monitor and analyze security threats in real time. Automated alerts and behavioral analytics help identify anomalies, while our 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) ensures immediate response. Our Incident Response Plan (IRP), aligned with NIST 800-61 guidelines, defines clear escalation procedures, containment strategies, and forensic investigation protocols to minimize impact and restore affected systems securely.\nTo prevent recurrence, we conduct root cause analyses, apply patch management, and update security controls based on lessons learned. Employees receive regular security training and phishing simulations to enhance threat awareness. Compliance with SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF is maintained through quarterly penetration testing and continuous improvement efforts. By integrating automation, rapid response, and ongoing security enhancement, we ensure a resilient security posture that effectively mitigates risks and safeguards our systems and data.",
      "status": "COMPLETE",
      "riskScore": 2,
      "reasoning": "The user's response is comprehensive and aligns well with industry best practices for security training and incident response. It describes a multi-layered approach, including the use of advanced tools like SIEM, IDPS, and EDR, which are essential for real-time threat detection and response. The inclusion of a 24/7 SOC, an Incident Response Plan aligned with NIST 800-61, and regular security training and phishing simulations are all indicative of a robust security posture. Furthermore, compliance with SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF, along with quarterly penetration testing, demonstrates a commitment to maintaining high security standards and continuous improvement.\n\nThe example response only mentions annual security awareness training and phishing simulations, which are basic components of a security training program. In contrast, the user's response covers a broader range of security measures, indicating a more mature and comprehensive security strategy.\n\nThe only potential concern could be the lack of specific details on how the security training is tailored to different roles within the company, which is a best practice to ensure relevance and effectiveness. However, given the overall depth and alignment with best practices, the suspicion level remains low."
