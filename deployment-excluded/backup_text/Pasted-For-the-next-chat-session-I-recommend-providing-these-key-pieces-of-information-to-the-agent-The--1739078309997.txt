For the next chat session, I recommend providing these key pieces of information to the agent:

The exact company name that needs the logo (e.g., "Brex")
The complete SVG code for the logo
The expected file path structure (e.g., "uploads/logos/logo_brex.svg")
This focused approach will help avoid the complications we encountered in this session. Would you like to:

Start a new chat with these simplified instructions
Continue with the current approach (not recommended)
Roll back to a previous working state using the rollback button
Which option would you prefer to proceed with?

I understand you want to continue working on the logos in a new chat. Here are the key points for the other agent:

Several company logos need to be implemented:

Sequoia Capital
SoFi
Square
Stripe
Tandem
Toast
The process for each logo:

User will provide the company name and SVG code
SVG needs to be written to /uploads/logos/logo_[company].svg (lowercase company name)
Database associations are already set up, just need to write the files
Toast logo has already been provided as:

Database and file structure are ready - just need to write the SVG files as they're provided.
Would you like me to proceed with implementing the Toast logo while you start a new chat for the remaining ones?
