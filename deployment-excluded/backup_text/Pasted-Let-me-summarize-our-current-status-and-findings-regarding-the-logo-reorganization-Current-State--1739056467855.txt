Let me summarize our current status and findings regarding the logo reorganization:

Current State:

Logo Files Location:
Successfully moved company logos to: /uploads/logos/
Current files in directory:
logo_bank-of-america.svg
logo_invela.svg (primary blue logo)
logo_invela-gray.svg
logo_invela-black.svg
Naming Convention:
Established consistent naming pattern: logo_company-name.svg
Removed redundant files and old naming formats
Pending Tasks:
Need to update code references to the new logo paths and names in:
server/routes.ts
server/run-migration.ts
db/schema.ts
server/migrations/rename_logos.ts
server/services/email/templates.ts
Confirmed:
No Ant or Betterment logos found in the system
All company logos are now centralized in /uploads/logos/
Removed duplicate files from /public directory
Next Steps:

Update code references to use the new logo paths
Update any UI components using the Invela logos
Verify the changes across the application
Would you like me to proceed with updating the code references?

Action: remove the logo_invela file/logo and replace it with logo_invela_blue since they're the same file code-wise. And this logo_invela_blue is the primary used logo for invela yes (for the company logo in the top left of the app, on the login page, etc.) unless specific otherwise (like for the breadcrumbs with gray and black) the invela_logo_blue is the primarily used version of the 3.

Question & Action: yes remove the original files (as long as that doesn't have any conflicts with deploying the app etc.)

Action: update all code references yes.

Question: as for your alternatives the idea here is that unless you can provide a reason for any of those alernatives, my understanding is that it would make sense to 1. have one singular location for company logos and 2. that those logos named in such a way that is consistent with the naming conventions used throughout the application for the company (i.e., Company Name is company-name and the logo for Copmany Name is logo_company-name.svg). Do you agree?
