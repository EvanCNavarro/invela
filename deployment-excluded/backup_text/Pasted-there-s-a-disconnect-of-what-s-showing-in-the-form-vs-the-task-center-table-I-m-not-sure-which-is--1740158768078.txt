there's a disconnect of what's showing in the form vs. the task center table. I'm not sure which is correct, but the data saving/updating/form populating is having problems.

Don't edit any code, and wait for my confirmation. Tell me:

Check through the code and walk through the logic.
Don't make any conclusions yet.
Just list out the flow and analyze the entire process for the kyb task logic.

I'll walk through the entire KYB task logic flow to understand where the data synchronization issues might be occurring:

Initial Task Creation and Data Flow:
Task is created with initial metadata
Task starts with status 'NOT_STARTED' and progress 0%
Task data is stored in the database
Form Loading Process:
a) When KYB form page loads (task-page.tsx):
Fetches task data with /api/tasks/kyb/${companyName}
Gets task metadata and saved form data
Sets initial form state and progress
b) OnboardingKYBFormPlayground component initialization:

Receives taskId, companyName, companyData, and savedFormData props
Initializes form state using useState hooks
Loads saved form data through useEffect
Form Data Management:
a) Data Storage:
Form data stored in formData state
Progress stored in progress state
Task metadata in database
b) Data Updates:

handleFormDataUpdate function updates form fields
Calculates new progress
Saves to backend via /api/kyb/progress
Updates task status via /api/tasks/${taskId}/status
Progress Calculation:
a) In form (OnboardingKYBFormPlayground.tsx):
calculateProgress calculates based on filled form fields
Uses TOTAL_FIELDS constant
Determines status based on progress thresholds
b) In task center:

Progress stored in task.progress
Updated through API endpoints
Data Persistence Flow:
Form updates trigger handleFormDataUpdate
Saves to backend
WebSocket notifications sent
Task center updates through query invalidation
Let me know if you want me to dig deeper into any specific part of this flow to identify where the synchronization issues might be occurring.

Now, do you notice any issues with our logic, code, and flow that might be leading to the data saving / populating / showing on the form / progress value matching / issues?

I've identified several potential issues in the current implementation that could be causing the data synchronization problems:

Would you like to proceed with one of these approaches:

Simplify the data flow by maintaining a single source of truth:

Store all form data in the task metadata
Calculate progress only when saving to backend
Load data only from the task endpoint
Keep the current architecture but add strict validation:

Add data integrity checks
Implement explicit state synchronization
Add logging for all data updates
Rebuild the form state management:

Use a form management library
Implement proper form state persistence
Add validation middleware
You can also use the rollback button in the chat pane to return to a previous working state if needed.

Which approach would you prefer to pursue?

Based on my analysis, I've identified several issues causing the data synchronization problems, particularly with progress tracking and form state. I have a comprehensive approach to fix these issues. Would you like me to:

Implement the single source of truth approach first?
Focus on fixing the progress calculation and empty value handling?
Or would you prefer to discuss the approach in more detail before making any changes?
Please let me know which direction you'd prefer to take.
