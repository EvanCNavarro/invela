Can you check if the new 'Show Side Drawer' button in Quick Actions works properly? When clicked, it should open a drawer and change to 'Hide Side Drawer'. The drawer should be closeable both via this button and the drawer's close button.

it seems like the dashboard's main content isn't adjusting to the activated pagesidedrawer. Before making any changes. Assess this. I assume it's because the logic and structure we worked on hasn't been updated for the other pages on the app? wait for my confirmation of your understanding.

Yes, I understand the issue. The main content area in the dashboard page isn't adjusting its margin when the PageSideDrawer is opened because we haven't properly implemented the responsive layout structure we developed earlier.

Let me explain what needs to be fixed:

In the OnboardingBuilderPage, we added the margin adjustment with:
<div className={`flex-1 min-w-0 ${drawerOpen ? 'mr-[27.25rem]' : ''}`}>
However, the dashboard page and other pages don't have this same layout structure yet. We need to:
Update the base layout structure in DashboardLayout to handle the drawer margin
Ensure this responsive behavior is consistent across all pages
Make the withPageSideDrawer HOC from our component available to wrap content sections
Would you like me to proceed with these fixes?

Got'cha, wait for my confirmation again, just tell me: I assume this issue with the maincontent resizing is also the case for every single page thoughout the app, so can we instead just standardize the logic of the app such that any page has the same template: main content (breadcrumbs if applicable, page header + page button (if defined), content) and sidebar (to be opened by default or openable/closeable). Does that make sense?

Yes, that makes perfect sense. Before proceeding, I want to confirm your requirements for the standardized page template structure:

Every page would follow the same template structure:

Main content area (with automatic margin adjustment)
Breadcrumbs (optional)
Page header + button (if defined)
Content
Side drawer (configurable as default-open or openable/closeable)
This would be implemented as a base template that all pages would inherit from

The drawer behavior (default-open vs. openable) would be configurable per page

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this standardized structure across the application? This will involve:

Creating a new base page template
Refactoring existing pages to use this template
Ensuring consistent drawer behavior throughout
Please confirm if this aligns with your vision for the application structure.

yes, that aligns with my vision for the application structure; proceed.

I'll standardize the application structure to ensure every page follows the same template pattern with proper responsive behavior for the PageSideDrawer. This will include:

Creating a consistent layout structure for all pages
Implementing proper margin adjustments when the drawer is open
Supporting both default-open and openable/closeable drawer modes
Let me start by updating the core components.
