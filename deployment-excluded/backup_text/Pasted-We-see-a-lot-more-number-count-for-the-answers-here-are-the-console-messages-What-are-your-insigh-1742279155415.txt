We see a lot more number count for the answers, here are the console messages.

What are your insights? Good and bad. Does the messages match your expected results from the changes we've been working on for this step of the implementation_plan.md?

I see that our field mapping changes are working - we're now getting answers properly mapped to fields. However, the high number of answers (139 for first file) suggests we need to implement stricter validation and deduplication. Would you like me to proceed with implementing answer validation and deduplication next?

Don't edit yet, just talk. Explain the changes that you'd make, and why.

Before proceeding with answer validation and deduplication, I notice we're getting unusually high answer counts (139 for one file). The agent proposes to:

Add similarity checks between answers
Filter duplicate answers within same field
Maintain confidence scores
Implement stricter validation
Would you like to:

Proceed with these changes
First review the current answers to understand what's causing the high counts
Rollback to the previous version using the rollback button
What would you prefer?

Well before all of that, isn't there a part in the implementation_plan.md, that is defined as sort of related to all of this? Like taking data/answers found for the same question, and then combining them into a single answer for the question itself (for later use) ?

Answer this first, don't edit, we're still investigating, planning this out.

You raise a good point. Looking at the implementation_plan.md, we have several stages of answer processing that need to happen:

First Stage (Completed):
✓ Getting answers mapped to correct field keys (what we just fixed)
✓ Basic metadata tracking working
✓ Progress tracking working
Missing Stage (What you're referring to):
Answer Aggregation: Taking all answers found for the same field/question across different chunks and combining them into a coherent single answer
This would involve:
Combining related answers
Keeping the highest confidence responses
Creating a consolidated response for each field
Maintaining traceability to source chunks
Final Stage (Still To Do):
Answer deduplication within the consolidated answers
UI updates to show the final aggregated answers
So yes, before we move to deduplication, we should implement proper answer aggregation to combine answers for the same fields across chunks. This would help reduce the high answer counts we're seeing (139) by consolidating related information.

Would you like me to explain the specific changes needed for the answer aggregation step?
