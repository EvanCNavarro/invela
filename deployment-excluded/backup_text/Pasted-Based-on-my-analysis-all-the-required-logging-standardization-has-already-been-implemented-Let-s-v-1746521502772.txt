Based on my analysis, all the required logging standardization has already been implemented. Let's verify that the logging is consistent across the files:

In persistKy3pResponses, the logging has correct namespace: { namespace: 'Ky3pPersistence', taskId }
In persistOpenBankingResponses, the logging has correct namespace: { namespace: 'OpenBankingPersistence', taskId }
In handleKybPostSubmission, the logging has correct namespace: { namespace: 'KybPostSubmission', taskId, companyId }
In handleKy3pPostSubmission, the logging has correct namespace: { namespace: 'Ky3pPostSubmission', taskId, companyId }
In handleOpenBankingPostSubmission, the logging has correct namespace: { namespace: 'OpenBankingPostSubmission', taskId, companyId }
In unlockTabsForCompany, the logging has correct namespace: { namespace: 'UnlockTabs', companyId }
In broadcastFormSubmissionResult, the logging has correct namespace: { namespace: 'BroadcastSubmission', taskId, formType, companyId }
Everything appears to be standardized and using the proper logger (not log) with appropriate namespaces and context objects.

Let me verify if there are any other references to 'log' as a variable that need to be changed to 'logger':


Executed grep -r "const log =" server/
Great! The search results only showed const log = in node modules and not in our application code, which means we've successfully replaced all instances of 'log' with 'logger'.

Let's do one more check to make sure there are no other log import statements that need to be updated:


Executed grep -r "import { log " server/
Let's also check for any destructuring imports that might pull 'log' from another module:


Executed grep -r "import {" server/ | grep " log " | grep -v "node_modules"
I'm analyzing your current work on the logging standardization for the unified form submission process. Let me review the progress and current status.

Based on the code I've examined:

✓ Updated persistKy3pResponses with proper namespace and logger format
✓ Updated persistOpenBankingResponses with consistent logging context
✓ Standardized handleKybPostSubmission logging with context objects
✓ Standardized handleKy3pPostSubmission with consistent format
✓ Standardized handleOpenBankingPostSubmission logging
✓ Updated unlockTabsForCompany with proper namespace context
✓ Standardized broadcastFormSubmissionResult logging

→ There's one remaining import in server/index.ts that needs to be updated:
import { setupVite, serveStatic, log } from "./vite";
