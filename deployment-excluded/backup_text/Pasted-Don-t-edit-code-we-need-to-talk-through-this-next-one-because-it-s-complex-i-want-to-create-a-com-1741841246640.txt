Don't edit code, we need to talk through this next one because it's complex.

i want to create a component the renders when the document upload option is selected. (like how there's a component that renders when the manual entry is selected)

So this component will be a step wizard for the user, that will allow them to 1. upload documents, then 2. the applicaiton will use openai to process analyze the content in the documents, then will try to answer the questions in the card (CardFormPlayground) form from the content in the documents, then 3. will show the total number of answers found and will be used as a page to prepare the full package of answers to put into the database for the form when the user clicks continue, then when the user hits continue it will change the component to the CardFormPlayground (and since the database was updated with the answers, it will have the autopopulated fields shown in the form as expected.

Now I have 5 images attached.
What I want you to do is process what I said, then compare with the screenshots, and ask a bunch of questions about the structure and components, such that we can come up with a plan of creating this multi step upload / process / review wizard for documents.

I have several questions about the document upload wizard implementation:

Document Upload UI (Step 1):
Should we support drag-and-drop AND click-to-select options?
Do we need to validate file types/sizes?
Should the document categories (SOC 2 Audit, ISO 27001, etc.) be configurable or hard-coded?
Should users be able to upload multiple files at once?
Processing Stage (Step 2):
Do we need real-time progress updates for each file?
Should we show which specific questions were answered from each document?
How should we handle conflicting answers from different documents?
Do we need to store the original documents somewhere?
Review Stage (Step 3):
Should we show a preview of the actual answers found?
Do we need any validation before allowing the user to continue?
Should we allow partial uploads if not all questions are answered?
Technical Integration:
Should we create a new database table for document uploads?
How should we structure the OpenAI prompts to extract answers from documents?
Should we process documents sequentially or in parallel?
How should we handle OCR for different document types?
Would you like to discuss these aspects before we start planning the implementation?
