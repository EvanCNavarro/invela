## User's Question (Refined)
I am developing a user survey form that allows users to enter information into text fields. When a user inputs their response, I want the application to process the text using AI to assign a "suspicion level"‚Äîa percentage (0-100%) indicating how much the response deviates from expected best practices.

The AI should compare the user‚Äôs response to predefined ideal responses and evaluate how well the input aligns with security and compliance standards. The suspicion level should contribute to a total risk score, which aggregates all partial risk scores to form a final company risk assessment.

I am using OpenAI‚Äôs API and want to know whether this functionality is possible. Specifically:
- Can AI evaluate the user‚Äôs response against predefined expected answers?
- Can it assign a suspicion level based on deviation from best practices?
- How should I structure the API request and scoring mechanism?

## AI's Response

Yes, this is absolutely possible using OpenAI‚Äôs API. You can implement this functionality by leveraging **GPT models** to analyze user inputs in real-time and assess how well their responses align with predefined expectations.

### **How It Works**
When a user enters a response into a form field, your application will:
1. **Capture the User‚Äôs Response** ‚Äì Store the raw text input.
2. **Compare Against Expected Responses** ‚Äì Use AI to compare the input with predefined criteria (such as example answers or best practices).
3. **Assign a Suspicion Level** ‚Äì The AI will determine how much the response deviates from expected responses and assign a **suspicion score (0-100%)**.
4. **Use the Score for Risk Calculation** ‚Äì The suspicion score will contribute to the total **partial risk score**, which accumulates into the **Invela Accreditation Risk Score (ARS)**.

### **Technical Implementation**
You'll want to:
- Use **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT API** to process user inputs.
- Structure your API prompt effectively to guide the AI‚Äôs evaluation.
- Implement a **scoring mechanism** to calculate the suspicion level.
- Return the suspicion level dynamically as users enter responses.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Example API Request**
When a user enters a response, send an API request like this:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an AI security compliance evaluator. Your job is to assess user-submitted security responses based on predefined best practices. Assign a 'suspicion level' from 0-100%, where 0% means perfect alignment with best practices, and 100% means highly suspicious, incomplete, or vague."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "User Response: 'We use a simple password policy for security.'\n\nExpected Best Practice: 'We enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and use strong password policies with minimum length and complexity requirements.'\n\nProvide a suspicion level percentage and reasoning."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Example AI Response**
```json
{
  "suspicion_level": 85,
  "reasoning": "The response does not mention MFA, complexity requirements, or password rotation policies. This suggests poor security hygiene."
}
```

### **Breaking Down the AI Processing**
1. **Comparison Against Expected Responses**  
   - The AI compares user input with **ideal** responses from your dataset.
   - If it closely matches best practices ‚Üí **Lower Suspicion Score (0-20%)**
   - If it‚Äôs vague or incomplete ‚Üí **Moderate Suspicion Score (30-70%)**
   - If it's misleading or incorrect ‚Üí **High Suspicion Score (80-100%)**

2. **Dynamic Prompting for Evaluation**  
   You can store predefined examples in your system and **dynamically structure the AI prompt**:
   ```
   User Input: [User‚Äôs response]
   Expected Response: [Ideal answer]
   Evaluate based on completeness, accuracy, and relevance.
   ```

3. **Final Score Calculation**  
   - Use the suspicion level to determine the **partial risk score** for each answer.
   - Aggregate all partial scores to compute the **total risk score**.

### **Enhancing the System**
- **Fine-Tune the Model** (Optional)  
  If you have a **large dataset of past responses**, you can train a fine-tuned model to evaluate responses more accurately.
  
- **Real-Time Feedback**  
  You can dynamically display feedback alongside suspicion scores, guiding users to provide better responses.

- **Weighting System**  
  Certain responses may be **more critical** (e.g., password policies) and should **contribute more** to the total risk score.

### **Is OpenAI‚Äôs API Capable of This?**
‚úÖ **Yes!** You can achieve this functionality **entirely** through the OpenAI API using GPT-4. This method allows real-time evaluation and integrates seamlessly into your security compliance form.
