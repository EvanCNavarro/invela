# Invela Platform - Comprehensive Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a complete set of instructions for reliably deploying the Invela Platform to Replit Cloud. We've implemented a robust multi-layered approach to ensure successful deployment even in challenging environments.

## Key Improvements

1. **Smart Path Resolution** - Automatically locates the correct application entry point
2. **Port Binding Reliability** - Ensures proper binding to port 8080 as required by Replit
3. **Multi-Location Deployment** - Places critical files in all potential locations
4. **Automated Troubleshooting** - Creates diagnostic logs and file maps

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Application

Run the comprehensive deployment build script:

```bash
./build-for-deployment.sh
```

This script:
- Builds the application with the standard process
- Prepares all deployment files and redirectors
- Verifies that all necessary files exist
- Generates diagnostic information

### Step 2: Configure Replit Deployment Settings

Use these exact settings in the Replit Deployment panel:

- **Build Command:** `./build-for-deployment.sh`
- **Run Command:** `NODE_ENV=production PORT=8080 node deployment-server.js`
- **Port:** `8080`

### Step 3: Deploy

Click the "Deploy" button in the Replit Deployments panel to start the deployment process.

## How It Works

Our deployment solution uses multiple layers of reliability:

### The Universal Deployment Server

The core of our solution is a smart deployment server that:

1. **Automatically Locates Entry Points** - Tries multiple potential paths to find the server
2. **Port Management** - Ensures the server binds to port 8080, even freeing it if needed
3. **Detailed Logging** - Provides comprehensive diagnostic information
4. **Fallback Mechanisms** - Includes multiple recovery strategies if issues occur

### Deployment Preparation

Our preparation script ensures:

1. **Critical Files Everywhere** - Copies the deployment server to all potential locations
2. **Entry Point Redirectors** - Creates redirectors that can find the real entry point
3. **Proper Permissions** - Sets execution permissions on all required files
4. **Diagnostic Tools** - Creates a map of JavaScript files for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

If deployment issues occur:

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"File Not Found" Error**
   - Our deployment server will automatically search multiple paths
   - Check the logs to see which paths were searched
   - Check the file map at `dist/file-map.txt` to see all available files

2. **Port Binding Issues**
   - The deployment server automatically attempts to free port 8080 if it's in use
   - Ensure no other processes are binding to port 8080

3. **Server Start Timeout**
   - The deployment server waits up to 10 seconds for port binding
   - Check logs for specific timeout errors

### Diagnostic Tools

The deployment process creates several diagnostic tools:

1. **File Map** - A complete list of JavaScript files at `dist/file-map.txt`
2. **Detailed Logs** - The deployment server logs detailed information about its actions
3. **Redirectors** - Special files that can help locate the correct entry point

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment uses a layered approach:

1. **Deployment Server** (`deployment-server.js`) - The main entry point for deployment
2. **Server Redirector** (`server/deployment-server.js`) - A redirector in the server directory
3. **Dist Redirector** (`dist/deployment-server.js`) - A redirector in the dist directory
4. **Index Redirector** (`dist/index.js`) - A redirector at the standard entry point

Each layer can locate and start the application, providing multiple fallback options.

## Customization

If needed, you can customize the deployment:

1. **Port Configuration** - Change the port in both `.replit.deploy.json` and `deployment-server.js`
2. **Entry Point Locations** - Add additional paths to the `findServerEntryPoint` function
3. **Timeout Configuration** - Adjust the timeout in the `waitForPort` function

## Maintenance

When updating the application:

1. **Always Run the Build Script** - Run `./build-for-deployment.sh` before deploying
2. **Check the Logs** - Review deployment logs for any potential issues
3. **Update Entry Points** - If your application structure changes, update the entry point paths
