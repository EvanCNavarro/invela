# KY3P Progress Fix Summary

## Problem

KY3P task progress was inconsistently calculated and often reset to 0% despite being correctly calculated as 100%. The key issues were:

1. Transaction boundary issues in `unified-progress.ts` where dynamic imports inside transactions would cause database updates to fail
2. Fundamental difference in how field references were handled between KYB forms (string-based field_key) and KY3P forms (numeric field_id)
3. Real-time UI updates via WebSocket worked, but database persistence was failing

## Solution: KISS Approach

We implemented a simple, direct solution that makes KY3P work exactly like KYB by using consistent field references:

1. Created `server/routes/ky3p-keyfield-router.ts` that mimics KYB's approach using string-based field_key references
2. Implemented both POST and GET endpoints in this router:
   - `/api/ky3p/keyfield-progress` for saving field data and progress
   - `/api/ky3p/keyfield-progress/:taskId` for retrieving field data and progress
3. Fixed router registration in `server/routes.ts`
4. Avoided dynamic imports inside transaction boundaries
5. Added extensive logging to track progress updates

## Testing and Verification

We verified the solution with the test script `test-ky3p-keyfield.js` which demonstrated:

1. Progress values are correctly saved to the database (60% in our test)
2. The task status is properly updated ("in_progress")
3. WebSocket broadcasts are functioning correctly
4. Progress values can be retrieved from the database

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplicity**: By making KY3P use field_key like KYB, we avoided special case handling
2. **Consistency**: All form types now use the same reference system
3. **Reliability**: Progress calculation and persistence now work the same way across all form types
4. **Maintainability**: Code paths are simplified and consistent, making future updates easier

## Implementation Steps

1. Created `ky3p-keyfield-router.ts` with POST and GET endpoints
2. Registered the router in `server/routes.ts`
3. Fixed dynamic imports in transaction boundaries
4. Improved error handling and logging
5. Created and ran tests to verify the solution

This fix ensures that when KY3P form progress is calculated as 100%, it will be correctly persisted in the database and displayed to users.
