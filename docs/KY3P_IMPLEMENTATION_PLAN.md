# S&P KY3P Security Assessment Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for replacing the existing "Security Assessment" task with a new "S&P KY3P Security Assessment" task using the Universal Form infrastructure. The new form will contain 120 questions from the S&P KY3P Security Assessment standard.

## Goals
1. Create a new task type for S&P KY3P Security Assessment
2. Import field definitions from the provided CSV
3. Create a form service for this task type
4. Update the task creation process to use this form instead of the old Security Assessment
5. Test the implementation thoroughly
6. Deploy the changes

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Database Schema and Data Import
- [x] Create database schema for KY3P fields
- [ ] Write a script to import field definitions from CSV
- [ ] Run database migrations

### Phase 2: Form Service Implementation
- [ ] Create KY3P form service extending the Universal Form infrastructure
- [ ] Register the service with ComponentFactory
- [ ] Add API endpoints for interacting with KY3P form data

### Phase 3: Task Creation Updates
- [ ] Update task creation logic to use KY3P task type instead of Security Assessment
- [ ] Update task title format to "2. S&P KY3P Security Assessment: {CompanyName}"
- [ ] Test task creation and assignment

### Phase 4: UI Enhancements
- [ ] Add any needed UI customizations for KY3P form
- [ ] Update task center to properly display KY3P tasks
- [ ] Ensure proper display of task details and progress

### Phase 5: Testing
- [ ] Create test plan
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing
- [ ] Verify form submission and data storage
- [ ] Test form validation

### Phase 6: Deployment
- [ ] Final review and validation
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Database Schema and Data Import
- [2023-04-20] Created database schema for KY3P fields âœ…

## Technical Architecture

### Database Structure
- **Table**: `ky3p_fields`
- **Key Columns**: id, order, field_key, label, description, section, field_type, etc.
- **Relations**: Links to tasks table via task type

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/ky3p-fields` - Get field definitions
- `POST /api/tasks/ky3p` - Create KY3P assessment task
- `GET /api/tasks/ky3p/:taskId` - Get KY3P task details
- `PUT /api/tasks/ky3p/:taskId/responses` - Save form responses

### Component Architecture
- `KY3PFormService` - Service for handling KY3P form data
- Universal Form Component - Reused for rendering
- Task Center UI - Updated to handle KY3P tasks

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Test each component and service in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interaction between components
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Test full user flow from task creation to form submission
4. **Validation Testing**: Ensure proper form validation
5. **Regression Testing**: Ensure other form types still work correctly

## Risk Assessment
- Complexity of importing 120 fields
- Potential impact on existing workflows
- Need for careful coordination with task creation process

## Success Criteria
- New KY3P tasks are created instead of Security Assessment
- Form presents all 120 questions correctly
- Data is properly validated and stored
- Form submission completes successfully
- Tasks show correct progress and status

## Future Enhancements
- Add analytics for KY3P compliance
- Create summary reports for KY3P assessments
- Add specialized validation rules for specific fields
