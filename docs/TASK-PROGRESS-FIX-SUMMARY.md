# Task Progress Fix Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix issues with task progress calculation across different task types. The focus of this phase was to ensure that KY3P task progress is not reset to 0% when editing a form, addressing a critical issue in the user experience.

## Problem Description

A critical bug was identified where editing a KY3P form that already had substantial progress (e.g., 96%) would cause the progress to be reset to 0%. This occurred because the form editing flow called the `clearAllFields` method, which in turn called the `/api/ky3p/clear-fields/{taskId}` endpoint that forcefully reset progress to 0% regardless of context.

## Solution Approach

Following the OODA framework (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) and KISS principles, we implemented a comprehensive solution instead of a bandaid fix:

1. Enhanced the server-side clear-fields endpoint with an optional `preserveProgress` parameter
2. Updated all client-side code paths to pass this parameter when appropriate
3. Ensured all three bulk update approaches consistently support the parameter

## Detailed Changes

### Server-Side Changes

- **Enhanced KY3P clear-fields endpoint**: Added support for an optional `preserveProgress` parameter, allowing progress to be maintained during form edits while still clearing field values

### Client-Side Changes

1. **handleClearFields.ts**:
   - Modified `handleClearFieldsUtil` to accept and use a `preserveProgress` parameter
   - Updated all three approaches (standardized bulk update, direct KY3P endpoint, alternative endpoint) to pass the `preserveProgress` parameter in both URL and body
   - Enhanced `directClearFields` function to handle the parameter appropriately for different form types

2. **standardized-ky3p-update.ts**:
   - Updated `standardizedBulkUpdate` function to accept and use options for `preserveProgress` and `isFormEditing`
   - Enhanced all three update approaches (responses array, direct raw format, bulk endpoint) to include the preserve parameter in both URL and body

## Testing

The implementation was tested with the following scenarios:

1. Editing a KY3P form with existing progress (96%) - progress is now correctly preserved
2. Clearing a KY3P form explicitly (non-editing context) - progress is correctly reset to 0%
3. Verified all three client-side approaches correctly pass the parameter

## Future Considerations

1. Apply a similar pattern to other form types (KYB, Open Banking) for consistency
2. Consider making progress preservation the default behavior for form editing across all form types
3. Add more extensive logging and telemetry to track progress calculation issues
