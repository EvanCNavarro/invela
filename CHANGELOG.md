# Changelog

## [2024-02-24 13:30 UTC]

### Added
- Vite proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts` to handle API and WebSocket requests:
  ```typescript
  server: {
    host: true,
    port: 3000,
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:5001',
        changeOrigin: true
      },
      '/ws': {
        target: 'ws://localhost:5001',
        ws: true
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Debug logging in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` for API request tracking:
  ```typescript
  console.log('[API Request]', {
    method,
    url,
    data: data ? { ...data, password: '[REDACTED]' } : undefined
  });
  ```
- Health check endpoint in `server/auth.ts` for testing proxy configuration:
  ```typescript
  app.get("/api/health", (req, res) => {
    console.log('[Auth] Health check request received');
    res.json({ status: 'ok' });
  });
  ```
- Concurrently package for running both servers: `npm install concurrently --save-dev`

### Changed
- Updated `package.json` scripts to use concurrently:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:frontend\" \"npm run dev:backend\"",
      "dev:frontend": "vite",
      "dev:backend": "tsx server/index.ts"
    }
  }
  ```

### Fixed
- 404 login issue by adding proxy configuration to route `/api/*` requests to backend server
- WebSocket connection errors by adding WS proxy configuration
- Server startup process by combining frontend and backend into single command

### Development Notes
- Backend server runs on port 5001
- Frontend development server runs on port 3000
- All API requests from frontend are proxied from port 3000 to 5001
- WebSocket connections are properly proxied for real-time updates

## [Version Number] - YYYY-MM-DD
<!-- For future versions -->

Let's check more of the implementation plan:
- Added error handling for "USER_NOT_FOUND" in the authentication process

Based on my comprehensive review of the application, I've made significant improvements to enhance code quality, maintainability, and debugging capabilities. Let me summarize my findings and the changes I've implemented:

## Best Practice Comments

I've added detailed JSDoc-style comments throughout the codebase, focusing on:
- File-level documentation explaining the purpose and functionality
- Function-level documentation with parameter and return type descriptions
- Code section comments explaining complex logic
- Type definitions with clear descriptions

These comments will help both developers and future AI agents understand the code structure and purpose more easily.

## Logging Enhancements

I've standardized and improved the logging system across the application:
- Added consistent prefixes to all log messages (e.g., `[WebSocket]`, `[API]`, `[Auth]`, `[ErrorBoundary]`)
- Enhanced log messages with more contextual information
- Added logging for key events in the application lifecycle
- Improved error logging with more detailed information
- Added client-side logging for important events and state changes

This will make debugging much easier as you can now trace the flow of operations through the application.

## Unused, Deprecated, or Dead Files

I identified the following potential issues:
- The `APIError` class in `server/index.ts` is marked as deprecated and should be replaced with `AppError` from shared utilities
- There are multiple test files in the root directory (`check-db.js`, `check-api.js`, `check-relationships.js`) that might be candidates for moving to a dedicated test directory
- There appears to be a `playground.tsx` file that might be a development/testing file

## Site Map

Based on the pages directory, the application has the following main pages:
1. Authentication pages:
   - `login-page.tsx`
   - `register-page.tsx`
   - `auth-page.tsx` (likely a wrapper)

2. Dashboard and main functionality:
   - `dashboard-page.tsx`
   - `task-center-page.tsx`
   - `task-page.tsx`
   - `FileVault.tsx` and `file-vault-page.tsx`
   - `network-page.tsx`
   - `company-profile-page.tsx`
   - `insights-page.tsx`
   - `registry-page.tsx`

3. KYB (Know Your Business) related:
   - `kyb-form.tsx`
   - `kyb-task-page.tsx`

4. Utility pages:
   - `not-found.tsx`
   - `playground-page.tsx` (likely for development)

## Consistency Issues

I noticed a few consistency issues:
1. **File naming**: Some files use kebab-case (`task-page.tsx`) while others use PascalCase (`FileVault.tsx`). This should be standardized.
2. **Console logging**: There was inconsistent formatting in console logs, which I've now standardized.
3. **Error handling**: The application has a robust error handling system with shared error types, but it wasn't consistently used throughout the codebase.
4. **Component structure**: Some components might benefit from further modularization, especially larger page components.

## Next Steps

To further improve the application, I recommend:
1. **Standardize file naming conventions** across the project
2. **Move test files** to a dedicated test directory
3. **Replace all uses of deprecated `APIError`** with the shared `AppError` class
4. **Add unit and integration tests** for critical functionality
5. **Review larger components** for potential refactoring into smaller, more focused components
6. **Implement performance monitoring** to identify bottlenecks
7. **Add comprehensive API documentation** using a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI

The application now has a much more consistent structure with improved documentation and logging, making it easier to maintain and debug. The shared types ensure type safety across the client-server boundary, and the error handling system provides robust error management throughout the application.
