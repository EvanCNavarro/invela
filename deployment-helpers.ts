/**
 * Vite Configuration Notes:
 * 
 * The absence of a server section in vite.config.ts is intentional.
 * When there's no explicit server configuration, Vite uses permissive defaults
 * that allow the Replit domain to access the application without host validation.
 * 
 * In server/vite.ts, the Vite server is created with a partial configuration
 * that only specifies middlewareMode and hmr settings. If vite.config.ts has
 * a server section, those settings would be overwritten, potentially causing
 * host validation issues.
 * 
 * Key points to remember:
 * 1. DO NOT add a server section to vite.config.ts
 * 2. If host validation issues occur, first check if vite.config.ts has a server section
 * 3. The configuration in server/vite.ts is sufficient for proper operation
