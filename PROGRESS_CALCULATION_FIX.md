# Progress Calculation Fix - KISS Principle Implementation

## Problem Statement

We identified an inconsistency in how task progress is tracked across our application:

1. Task progress was being stored in two separate locations:
   - The primary `progress` column in the tasks table
   - A secondary `progressValue` in the `metadata` JSON field

2. This caused inconsistencies when:
   - One value was updated but not the other
   - Different code paths used different fields
   - UI displayed one value while logic used the other

3. The specific issue with task #694:
   - Progress showed as 0% in the UI (reading from primary field)
   - Status showed as "submitted" (using metadata.progressValue)
   - Extremely confusing for users

## Solution: Apply KISS Principle

The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle dictates that we should maintain a single source of truth for progress tracking.

### Implementation Details

1. **Updated unified-progress-fixed.ts**:
   - Removed duplicate progress tracking in metadata
   - Ensured all updates properly write to the primary progress field
   - Kept audit metadata (timestamps, sources) but eliminated duplicate data

2. **Created fix-task-progress-duplicates.ts**:
   - Script to fix existing tasks with duplicate progress tracking
   - For task #694, updates the primary progress field to match the metadata value
   - Removes progressValue from metadata to prevent future issues
   - Also finds and fixes any other tasks with this issue

3. **Status Determination Logic**:
   - Now consistently uses the primary progress field
   - Status calculation follows:
     - 0% → NOT_STARTED
     - 1-99% → IN_PROGRESS
     - 100% (not submitted) → READY_FOR_SUBMISSION
     - 100% (with submission flag) → SUBMITTED

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: One field to track, update, and display
2. **Consistency**: All code paths use the same field
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and understand
4. **Reliability**: Eliminates risk of desynchronization
5. **Better User Experience**: Status and progress will now match correctly

## Running the Fix

To apply this fix to task #694 and any other affected tasks:

```bash
npx tsx fix-task-progress-duplicates.ts
```

## Long-term Guidelines

1. Always use the primary `progress` field for storing task progress
2. Do not create duplicate progress tracking in metadata
3. Use metadata only for audit and tracking information, not primary data
4. Follow the KISS principle: avoid redundant tracking of the same value
