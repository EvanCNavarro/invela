# WebSocket Architecture Consolidation Plan

## Phase 1: Complete System Audit

### 1.1 File Classification System
- **ACTIVE**: Currently used in production
- **LEGACY**: Old implementation, potentially unused
- **DUPLICATE**: Multiple implementations of same functionality
- **BROKEN**: Non-functional or error-prone code
- **TEST**: Development/testing files
- **CORE**: Essential infrastructure files

### 1.2 Socket Usage Pattern Analysis
- **Direct Connection**: `new WebSocket()` calls
- **Service Layer**: Abstracted through service classes
- **Hook Pattern**: React hooks wrapping connections
- **Provider Pattern**: Context providers managing connections
- **Event Listeners**: Components listening to existing connections
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for socket operations

### 1.3 Functionality Mapping
For each file, document:
- What specific WebSocket functionality it provides
- Which components depend on it
- What data it sends/receives
- How it handles connection lifecycle
- Whether it's redundant with other implementations

## Phase 2: Dependency Analysis

### 2.1 Component Dependency Tree
Map which components use which socket implementations to understand:
- Overlapping functionality
- Critical dependencies
- Safe-to-remove candidates

### 2.2 Data Flow Analysis
Document what each socket connection is actually doing:
- Authentication messages
- Task updates
- Form submissions
- Tutorial progress
- File uploads
- Real-time notifications

## Phase 3: Unified Architecture Design

### 3.1 Single WebSocket Service
Design one centralized service that handles:
- Connection management
- Authentication
- Message routing
- Reconnection logic
- Error handling

### 3.2 Event Bus Pattern
Create a pub/sub system where:
- Components subscribe to specific event types
- Single WebSocket publishes to event bus
- No component directly manages connections

### 3.3 Migration Strategy
- Incremental replacement approach
- Backwards compatibility during transition
- Feature parity validation
- Performance monitoring

## Phase 4: Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Preservation Requirements
Ensure all current functionality is preserved:
- Task status updates
- Real-time form feedback
- Tutorial progress tracking
- File upload status
- System notifications

### 4.2 Testing Strategy
- Connection stress testing
- Feature functionality validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Error recovery testing

## Success Metrics
- Reduce from 30-60 connections to 1 per user
- Eliminate modal rendering race conditions
- Improve application performance
- Simplify debugging and maintenance
