36. **server/services/unified-file-tracking.ts** - ✅ MIXED INTEGRATION (PARTIALLY COMPLIANT)
    - Uses: broadcastTaskUpdate from unified-websocket AND WebSocketService.broadcast
    - Pattern: Mix of unified utilities and direct service calls
    - Status: Compliant with current architecture

37. **server/services/unified-form-submission-handler.ts** - ✅ UNIFIED INTEGRATION
    - Uses: broadcastFormSubmission from unified-websocket
    - Pattern: Proper service-level integration
    - Status: Compliant with architecture

38. **server/services/unified-form-submission-service.ts** - ✅ MIXED INTEGRATION (PARTIALLY COMPLIANT)
    - Uses: broadcastTaskUpdate from unified-websocket AND WebSocketService direct calls
    - Pattern: Mix of unified utilities and direct service calls
    - Status: Compliant with current architecture

39. **server/services/universalDemoAutoFillService.ts** - ✅ UNIFIED INTEGRATION
    - Uses: broadcastTaskUpdate from unified-websocket

    - Status: Compliant with architecture

40. **server/services/synchronous-task-dependencies.ts** - ✅ UNIFIED INTEGRATION
    - Uses: broadcastTaskUpdate from unified-websocket
    - Pattern: Proper service-level integration
    - Status: Compliant with architecture

41. **server/services/company-tabs.ts** - ✅ UNIFIED INTEGRATION
    - Uses: broadcastTabsUpdated (aliased) from unified-websocket
    - Pattern: Proper service-level integration
    - Status: Compliant with architecture

42. **server/services/unified-tab-service.ts** - ✅ UNIFIED INTEGRATION
    - Uses: broadcast from unified-websocket
    - Pattern: Proper service-level integration
    - Status: Compliant with architecture

43. **server/services/unified-clear-fields.ts** - ⚠️ WEBSOCKET CONTEXT USAGE (REVIEW NEEDED)
    - Uses: broadcast and broadcastTaskUpdate from unified-websocket AND WebSocketContext
    - Pattern: Advanced WebSocket context management
    - Status: REQUIRES REVIEW - Uses WebSocketContext which may conflict with unified approach

## Remaining Investigation Areas

### High Priority Components to Check
- Form components in `/components/forms/` (4 remaining)
- Task-related components in `/components/tasks/`
- Modal components that might have real-time updates
- Tutorial components in `/components/tutorial/`

### Service Layer to Check
- Other form services in `/services/` directory
- Authentication services
- File management services
- Progress tracking services

### Page Components Remaining
- Specialized task pages (KY3P, KYB, Open Banking)
- Company profile pages
- Authentication pages

## Summary of Issues Found
1. **3 CRITICAL**: Broken imports causing runtime errors
2. **1 MEDIUM**: Legacy WebSocket pattern needing migration
3. **13 COMPLIANT**: Proper unified WebSocket usage
4. **Multiple**: Clean implementations with no WebSocket usage

## Next Steps
1. Continue systematic component investigation
2. Check all remaining form components
3. Examine tutorial system components
4. Review task-specific components
5. Document all findings for consolidation plan
