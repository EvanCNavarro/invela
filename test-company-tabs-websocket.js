TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
=======================================================================

To test the file vault unlocking fix:

1. Navigate to a task detail page for a company
2. Submit a KYB form (or use an already submitted one)
3. Observe the File Vault tab in the sidebar
4. The tab should become accessible immediately after submission
   without requiring a page refresh

Key changes made:
- Modified DashboardLayout to handle WebSocket events for all companies
- Removed company ID dependency in WebSocket subscription
- Set up WebSocket subscriptions immediately, not waiting for company data

These changes ensure the UI properly responds to file vault unlocking
across different company contexts and user sessions.
