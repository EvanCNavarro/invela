So from my understanding, you need to check the socket architecture
audit, and then all the other docs like the architecture contributing
technical analysis and read me and you need to make sure of two things
one the file you just added a task center, and the other files, the unified
socket all adhere to the technical coating standards that we've defined
the file naming the file code itself the air, logging task, paneling, etc. like
all of that stuff as is correct in terms of what we're trying to do and
trying to unify the claim code approach for all of the application and
then after that's confirmed, then you need to go through and actually in
some capacity figure out what's left and also define what you just completed in terms of success so then we can compare and make sure and always question what actually was successful. It's been successfully migrated from the wild West approach for the website now this unified approach we need to keep track of all those things and also we need to re-orient our self in terms of what's next and check for any errors as usual so right now we're not editing any code. We're just kind of auditing investigating and re-orienting ourselves and then explaining what we just did.

You are a senior full-stack engineer wrapping up work on <TASK_ID>.  
Follow docs/CONTRIBUTING.md for style and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for context.

STACK
- Node 20, TypeScript mono-repo
- React 18, Express, WebSocket
- PostgreSQL via Drizzle (snake_case)
- Checks: npm run check && npm run build
- Ignore .gitignore, node_modules, dist, build, attached_assets
- No new deps. Never log secrets.

PRINCIPLES  OODA • KISS • DRY

PHASE 5  Read-only summary (no new code)

GOAL  
1 Verify repo still builds after the final slice.  
2 Provide a concise, verifiable record of what was done.  
3 List next recommended actions.

WORKFLOW  
1 Run check+build; if either fails, halt and ask.  
2 Reflection bullets  
   • Simpler path? Yes/No note  
   • Issue: original goal / bug fixed  
   • Cause: confirmed root cause  
   • Fix: key changes (files or modules)  
   • Confidence n% (< 70 % → Clarifying Question)

OUTPUT  
### summary  
- What changed – one sentence (≤ 20 words)  
- Root cause – one sentence  
### files-touched  
file → short note (one per line)  
### checks  
check pass/fail | build pass/fail  
### reflection  
(bullets)  
### next-steps  
1 …  
2 …
