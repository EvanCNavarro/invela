WebSocket Investigation Plan
Phase 1: Application Structure Analysis
Goal: Map all tabs, pages, and components to create a complete inventory

1.1 Main Navigation Tabs (from sidebar)
Dashboard
Task Center
File Vault
Company Profile
Risk Score
Network
Insights
Claims
Playground
1.2 Sub-pages and Routes Analysis
For each main tab, I need to identify:

Primary page components
Modal components
Form components
Service files
Hook files
Utility files
Phase 2: Systematic WebSocket Audit
Goal: Find every WebSocket implementation and categorize it

2.1 Search Strategy
For each component/file, I will search for:

WebSocket (direct usage)
webSocket (camelCase usage)
useWebSocket (custom hooks)
WebSocketService (service implementations)
socket (variable references)
ws (WebSocket server references)
broadcast (broadcasting functions)
subscribe (event subscriptions)
onmessage (message handlers)
send (message sending)
2.2 Documentation Template
For each finding, I will document:

File: [path]
Type: [Component/Service/Hook/Utility]
WebSocket Usage: [Direct/Service/Hook]
Current Implementation: [Unified/Legacy/Mixed]
Issues Found: [Description]
Dependencies: [Related files]
Phase 3: Implementation Categories
Goal: Classify each WebSocket usage

3.1 Implementation Types
Unified: Uses our unified WebSocket service
Legacy: Uses old WebSocket implementations
Mixed: Uses both (conflict risk)
Broken: Non-functional implementations
Duplicate: Multiple implementations for same feature
3.2 Feature Categories
Task progress updates
Form submissions
File uploads/management
Real-time notifications
Tutorial system
Authentication
Company data sync
Risk score calculations
Phase 4: Execution Plan
4.1 Investigation Order

4.2 Service Layer Investigation
Authentication services
Data fetching services
Form submission handlers
File management services
Notification systems
Tutorial management
Progress tracking utilities
4.3 Hook Investigation
Custom WebSocket hooks
Form hooks that use WebSocket
Data synchronization hooks
Real-time update hooks
Phase 5: Reporting Structure
Goal: Create comprehensive audit report

5.1 Summary Report
Total files audited
WebSocket implementations found
Implementation type breakdown
Critical issues identified
Consolidation recommendations
5.2 Detailed Findings
File-by-file analysis
Dependency mapping
Conflict identification
Performance implications
Execution Methodology
I will proceed systematically:

Start with the main application structure
Examine each tab's primary components
Dive into sub-components and services
Document findings in real-time
Identify patterns and conflicts
Create prioritized fix recommendations
Rules for Investigation:

No code editing until complete audit
Document every WebSocket-related finding
Note both functional and broken implementations
Identify all dependencies between components
Flag any security or performance concerns
This plan will ensure we find every single WebSocket usage in the application and can properly consolidate them to the unified approach.
