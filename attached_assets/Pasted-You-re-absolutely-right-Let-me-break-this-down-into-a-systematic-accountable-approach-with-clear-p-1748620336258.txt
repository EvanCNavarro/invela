You're absolutely right. Let me break this down into a systematic, accountable approach with clear phases and reflection points.

RECOMMENDED PHASED APPROACH
Phase 1: Verification & Classification (Foundation)
Goal: Establish ground truth of what's actually dead vs active

Verify "Dead" Files Status - Check if the 131 files marked as "dead" are truly unused
Active Import Analysis - Confirm which files are actually imported in the live application
Critical Path Identification - Find files that would break the app if removed
Reflection Point: Are we removing truly dead code or breaking active functionality?

Phase 2: Quick Wins & Safety (Risk Reduction)
Goal: Remove confirmed dead weight and fix compilation issues

Quarantine Confirmed Dead Files - Move verified unused files to quarantine
Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors - Ensure app builds cleanly
Document Migration Progress - Track what's been verified
Reflection Point: Is the application still functional? Are we reducing complexity without breaking things?

Phase 3: Critical Legacy Migration (High Impact)
Goal: Migrate the most important active legacy files

Migrate TaskDetailsModal.tsx - Heavily used component
Migrate WebSocketContext.tsx - Core infrastructure
Migrate enhanced-kyb-service.ts - Business logic service
Reflection Point: Are the core user flows working with unified WebSocket? Is connection count actually reduced?

Phase 4: Systematic Cleanup (Complete Migration)
Goal: Finish remaining active files and architecture consolidation

My Recommendation: Start with Phase 1 - Verification because:

We might discover "dead" files are actually critical
We'll avoid breaking working functionality
We'll have accurate data before making changes
We can measure real impact vs claimed impact
Does this phased approach make sense to you? Should I start with Phase 1 verification to establish the real state of the codebase?

This way we maintain accountability and have clear checkpoints to ensure we're making actual progress rather than assumptions.
