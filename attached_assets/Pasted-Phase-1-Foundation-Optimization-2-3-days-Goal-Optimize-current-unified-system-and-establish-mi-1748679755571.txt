Phase 1: Foundation & Optimization (2-3 days)
Goal: Optimize current unified system and establish migration patterns

Step 1.1: Create service inventory documentation

Document all 32 legacy WebSocket services discovered
Map their current usage patterns and dependencies
Identify critical vs non-critical services
Step 1.2: Optimize Sidebar filtering

Implement targeted message filtering instead of processing all task updates
Add client-side filtering by taskId relevance
Reduce unnecessary re-renders
Step 1.3: Enhance unified service monitoring

Add connection tracking to identify parallel connections
Implement service usage metrics
Create migration validation tools
Phase 2: High-Impact Migrations (3-4 days)
Goal: Replace the most problematic legacy implementations

Step 2.1: Migrate tutorial WebSocket system

Replace use-tutorial-websocket.ts with unified service subscriptions
Consolidate tutorial-specific message types
Test tutorial functionality with unified system
Step 2.2: Replace legacy server routes

Migrate server/routes/task-websocket.ts to unified broadcaster
Remove direct WebSocket implementations
Ensure server-side message routing consistency
Step 2.3: Consolidate dashboard widgets

Update real-time dashboard components to use unified service
Remove direct WebSocket connections in widgets
Implement proper subscription patterns
Phase 3: System Consolidation (2-3 days)
Goal: Eliminate remaining parallel connections

Step 3.1: Remove form workflow legacy implementations

Update form submission WebSocket handling
Consolidate submission status tracking
Test form real-time updates
Step 3.2: Server-side broadcast consolidation

Ensure all server components use unified broadcaster
Remove duplicate broadcasting utilities
Validate message delivery consistency
Step 3.3: Connection validation and cleanup

Verify single connection per user
Remove unused WebSocket service files
Update import statements throughout codebase
Phase 4: Performance Validation (1-2 days)
Goal: Confirm architecture improvements

Step 4.1: Connection monitoring

Validate single WebSocket connection per user
Measure message delivery performance
Test under concurrent user scenarios
Step 4.2: Race condition elimination

Verify modal rendering stability
Test rapid navigation scenarios
Confirm state consistency across components
