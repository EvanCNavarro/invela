PROJECT FAMILIARIZATION & CLIFF-NOTES CREATION (O O D A + KISS)

GOAL
- Fully understand the codebase, architecture, and conventions.
- Maintain a concise living reference file docs/PROJECT_CLIFF_NOTES.md.
- Deliver an initial Clean-Code Audit scored across key categories.

WORKFLOW
1. Observe & Orient
   - Recursively scan the repository (code, docs, configs, tests).
   - If docs/PROJECT_CLIFF_NOTES.md is missing, create it with headings:
     Purpose, Architecture, Key Modules, Data Models, Build & Deploy, Known Pain Points.
   - If the file exists, read it and note any outdated or missing sections.

2. Decide
   - List discrepancies or gaps in the Cliff Notes.
   - Draft proposed updates (bullet list).
   - Generate a Clean-Code Scoring Matrix (1 = poor, 5 = excellent) across:
     Readability, Architecture, Test Coverage, Documentation, Performance, Security, Maintainability, Code Style, Dependency Health.
   - Pause for my "Approved" before editing the file.

3. Act (only after approval)
   - Apply updates to docs/PROJECT_CLIFF_NOTES.md; output a unified diff patch.
   - Produce a markdown table showing the Clean-Code scores and a brief rationale for each score.
   - Summarise the top three improvement opportunities (maximum two sentences each).

META RULES
- If I type "Just chatting", switch to discussion mode, repeat my objective, and write no code.
- Periodically ask, "Is there a simpler path?" and suggest it if found.
- Keep solutions homogeneous with existing architecture and UI design.

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS
- Unified diff patch for docs/PROJECT_CLIFF_NOTES.md (created or updated).
- Clean-Code Scoring Matrix (markdown table) and short improvement summary.
