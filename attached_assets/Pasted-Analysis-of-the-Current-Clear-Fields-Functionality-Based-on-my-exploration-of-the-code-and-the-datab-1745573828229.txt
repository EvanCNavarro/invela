Analysis of the Current Clear Fields Functionality
Based on my exploration of the code and the database results, I can provide a detailed explanation of how the Clear Fields functionality is currently structured and why we're seeing the behavior we observed:

Components of the Clear Fields System
1. Client-Side Implementation:
clearFieldsUtils.ts: Contains the handleClearFields function which is responsible for making an HTTP POST request to /api/universal-clear-fields/${taskId} with the task type
UniversalForm.tsx: Includes a "Clear Fields" button that calls handleClearFieldsClick which uses the handleClearFields utility
2. Server-Side Implementation:
universal-clear-fields.ts: This route handler processes the clear fields request, contains logic to:
Delete responses from the appropriate table based on task type (kybResponses, ky3pResponses, openBankingResponses)
Update the task record to reset progress, status, and form data
Return a success response with the number of fields cleared
3. Route Registration:
The route is registered in server/routes.ts with app.use('/api/universal-clear-fields', universalClearFieldsRouter)
What's Currently Working
When you click the "Clear Fields" button:

The UI shows that fields are cleared (the form shows empty fields)
The task status is reset to "not_started"
The progress bar is reset to 0%
The database records are updated to have empty response values ("") and their status is set to "EMPTY"
What's Happening Under the Hood
From our database investigation, we found that:

There are 30 kyb_responses records for task 637
All of them have empty response values ("") and "EMPTY" status
The task status is reset properly
The approach being used doesn't actually delete the records from the database but rather updates them by setting their values to empty strings and their status to "EMPTY". This is why when we queried for non-empty fields, we found 0 results, but when we queried the total count, we still found 30 records.

This is actually a valid approach to clearing fields, as it:

Maintains the record IDs and relationships (which might be important for auditing or history)
Allows for faster re-population since the records already exist
Avoids potential foreign key issues that might arise from completely deleting records
Contrast with Your Original Expectations
It seems like you were expecting the Clear Fields functionality to completely delete the records from the database. However, the implementation is instead updating the records to be empty.
