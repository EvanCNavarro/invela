I'm investigating the data creation scripts and infrastructure to understand how companies, banks, and other entities are populated in the system.


Searched for "Find scripts for creating companies, banks, or bulk data population"
I found the data creation infrastructure! There's a comprehensive system for generating companies and related entities:


Opened server/utils/fintech-company-generator.ts
Looking at the data creation infrastructure, I found several key components:


Searched for "Find scripts or utilities for bulk data creation, seeding, or population scripts"
I've found the comprehensive data creation infrastructure in the system. Here's what I discovered:

Primary Data Generation Systems
1. FinTech Company Generator (server/utils/fintech-company-generator.ts)

Generates 100 diverse FinTech companies for bank network scenarios
Creates authentic business data with proper risk score distribution
Includes APPROVED companies (risk scores 1-35) and PENDING companies (risk scores 65-95)
Automatically links all companies to the Invela network
Uses batch processing for database insertion
2. Demo File Vault Population (server/utils/demo-file-vault.js)

Automatically populates company file vaults with standard demo files
Adds 4 standard files: SOC 2, ISO 27001, Penetration Test, and Business Continuity Plan questions
Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
Has testing scripts for validation
3. Business Details Generator (referenced in fintech generator)

Generates authentic business names, addresses, and operational data
Supports different persona types for specialized generation
Creates realistic financial and operational metrics
Key Features Found:
Batch Processing: Companies are inserted in batches of 10 for performance
Progress Tracking: Real-time progress reporting during generation
Data Integrity: Mathematical consistency in risk scores and relationships
Relationship Creation: Automatic network relationship establishment
File Vault Integration: Demo companies get pre-populated with sample files
Testing Infrastructure: Dedicated test scripts for validation
Script Locations:
Main generator: server/utils/fintech-company-generator.ts
File vault: server/utils/demo-file-vault.js
Test scripts: server/scripts/testing/
The system appears to be specifically designed for FinTech company generation rather than general banks, but it creates a comprehensive ecosystem of companies with proper risk profiles and network relationships. Would you like me to examine any specific aspect of this data generation system or look into how it could be extended for other entity types?
