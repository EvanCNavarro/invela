Feature: Risk Monitoring Insights – Deteriorating Data Recipients

Purpose

This new section of the Insights page highlights Data Recipients (DRs) whose S&P Data Access Risk Scores (DARS) are declining. It helps banks and Invela admins monitor emerging risk, understand who may soon be blocked, and take proactive steps to intervene.

Top-Level Visual Indicator: Blocked DRs
	•	A prominent visual alert at the top of the Insights view
	•	Shows the number of DRs currently blocked due to low DARS scores (e.g. below a threshold like 40)
	•	Color-coded (red) for critical visibility
	•	Includes hover or tooltip text like:
“These companies have been automatically blocked due to a DARS below the minimum risk threshold.”
	•	Clicking the alert can scroll or anchor the page down to the full table for deeper review

DARS Risk Deterioration Table

This table lists Data Recipients experiencing the sharpest declines in risk score over short periods of time.

Toggle Views
	•	Two timeframes selectable above the table:
	•	7-Day DARS Change
	•	30-Day DARS Change

Table Columns
	•	Company Name – Name of the Data Recipient
	•	Current DARS – Their current S&P Data Access Risk Score
	•	Score Change – Net change over 7 or 30 days (e.g., “−12.4”)
	•	Trend Arrow – Up or down icon, color-coded for fast visual cue
	•	Status – One of: “Stable”, “Monitoring”, “Approaching Block”, “Blocked”
	•	Sorted by greatest negative change first
	•	Optionally filtered by sector, accreditation level, or company size

Placement in the UI
	•	The Blocked DRs visual indicator is placed above the Insights funnel and consent activity graphs — this keeps risk exposure highly visible at all times
	•	The DARS deterioration table sits in its own section below the existing graphs, as a deep-dive analytic layer

Why This Feature Matters
	•	Adds real-time visibility into emerging risk events
	•	Encourages preemptive action before companies fall below risk thresholds
	•	Extends Invela’s trust layer by tying data access to dynamic risk signals
	•	Separates “engagement insights” (like consents and growth) from “integrity risks” (like score decay), providing clarity and balance
