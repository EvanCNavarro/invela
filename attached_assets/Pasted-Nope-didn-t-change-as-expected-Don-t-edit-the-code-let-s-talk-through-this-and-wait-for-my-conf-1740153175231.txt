Nope, didn't change as expected.

Don't edit the code, let's talk through this, and wait for my confirmation before doing anything, since the changes you've been making aren't working.

What would best practices be for trying to solve this issue and work with this logic of the form updating accordingly?

(I'm wondering also, should there be a check or function that happens when leaving the form or navigating to the task center that checks the task.progress value and then uses the breakpoint logic to check what the status should be, then checks the task.status that exists, and then overrides if they don't match. Not sure if this is best practice, but i'm just thinking of different solutions that you have not suggested yet.

Come up with at least 5 solutions/fixes/new ideas that would help with this current issue and would allow for expansion of a similar sense for other type of tasks like file uploading, form file saving, etc.

Let me propose several potential solutions for handling the task status/progress synchronization issue, before we implement any changes:

Form Exit Handler Approach:
Implement an onExit or beforeUnmount handler in the KYB form
When leaving the form, calculate the expected status based on progress
If there's a mismatch between calculated and current status, trigger a status update
This ensures consistency when navigating away from forms
Status/Progress State Machine:
Define a proper state machine for task status transitions
Include progress thresholds and validation rules
Store the state machine configuration in the database
Implement a validator service that ensures status and progress stay in sync
This provides a centralized way to manage all task type transitions
Background Task Status Reconciliation:
Implement a periodic background job that checks for mismatches
Scan all tasks and verify their status matches their progress
Auto-correct any inconsistencies found
Log all corrections for audit purposes
This catches any edge cases that slip through
Event-Based Status Updates:
Switch to an event-driven architecture for status updates
Emit events for progress changes
Have a dedicated status manager service subscribe to these events
Calculate and update status based on progress events
This decouples progress tracking from status management
Progressive Task Middleware:
Create a new middleware specifically for progressive tasks
Handle all progress/status coordination in one place
Implement different strategies for different task types
Add hooks for custom validation per task type
This provides a reusable solution for all progressive tasks
Two-Phase Status Updates:
Split status updates into validation and execution phases
First phase: validate new status against current progress
Second phase: perform the update if validation passes
Roll back both if either phase fails
This ensures atomic updates
Task Context Provider:
Create a higher-order component that manages task state
Include progress calculation and status determination
Provide consistent status management across all task types
Handle edge cases like form abandonment
This centralizes task state management in the frontend
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches before we implement a solution?

Yes, elaborate on each step by providing the following:
