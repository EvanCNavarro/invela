üß† Context & Purpose

The Consent Activity Insights Graph in the Invela Replit app provides a visual breakdown of data-sharing activity over time, specifically:
	‚Ä¢	Active Consents ‚Äì total live, ongoing consents
	‚Ä¢	Newly Granted Consents ‚Äì consents issued within a given time window

Users can filter the data by:
	‚Ä¢	Timeframe (1 Day, 30 Days, 1 Year)
	‚Ä¢	Company (dropdown with smart logic based on user type)

üß≠ Dropdown Filtering Logic ‚Äì Company Type Behavior

The company selector dropdown is dynamically filtered based on the type of user‚Äôs company:

If user belongs to a Fintech (Data Recipient):
	‚Ä¢	Show only their own company (no dropdown interaction required)
	‚Ä¢	Do not show dropdown UI at all ‚Äî the graph is locked to their own activity
	‚Ä¢	This prevents confusion or access to irrelevant entities

If user belongs to a Bank or Invela (Data Provider or Admin):
	‚Ä¢	Show dropdown chevron button
	‚Ä¢	Opens a searchable, alphabetically sorted list of all companies in their network (i.e., companies they can view)
	‚Ä¢	Enables fuzzy search (by name, partial keyword, etc.) to quickly find and select a company

üß© Why Fallback Defaults Are Needed

New or recently onboarded companies may not yet have any consent activity data in the system. Without fallback data, this graph could appear empty, broken, or non-functional ‚Äî which may:
	‚Ä¢	Confuse the user
	‚Ä¢	Undermine confidence in the system
	‚Ä¢	Prevent users from understanding what the feature is meant to show

To solve this, we provide realistic, proportional default values that:
	‚Ä¢	Keep the graph visually consistent
	‚Ä¢	Help users understand expected usage patterns
	‚Ä¢	Reflect healthy, believable engagement
	‚Ä¢	Respect the underlying 17:1 ratio between Active and New Consents

üîç Ratio Logic: 17 to 1

From real data in the platform (based on screenshots showing millions of consents and hundreds of thousands of denials), we‚Äôve seen consistent ratios of 30‚Äì35:1 for total consents to denials. To simplify and soften these for default display, we use a 17:1 ratio for Active vs. Newly Granted Consents.

This keeps things visually expressive, while:
	‚Ä¢	Aligning with actual usage dynamics
	‚Ä¢	Feeling appropriate for early-stage or growth-stage companies
	‚Ä¢	Preventing the default state from appearing artificially high or overly sparse

üìä Default Graph Values (No Company Data Present)

If the selected company has no activity, use the following placeholder data in the graph:

1 Day
	‚Ä¢	Newly Granted Consents: 1,000
	‚Ä¢	Active Consents: 17,000

30 Days
	‚Ä¢	Newly Granted Consents: 25,000
	‚Ä¢	Active Consents: 425,000

1 Year
	‚Ä¢	Newly Granted Consents: 300,000
	‚Ä¢	Active Consents: 5,100,000

‚úÖ Why These Values Work
	‚Ä¢	1,000 new consents per day is modest but active ‚Äî appropriate for companies just ramping up
	‚Ä¢	25,000 over 30 days indicates strong momentum and supports narrative of platform adoption
	‚Ä¢	300,000 in a year with 5.1M active feels reasonable when benchmarked against your actual data (which showed 22M‚Äì41M active consents for mature clients)
	‚Ä¢	Maintains visual integrity of the graph while avoiding dead or zero states
