I'll list out all the KYB form questions organized by their sections:

Entity Identification:
What is the full, registered name of the business?
What is your corporation number or business number (e.g., issued by Corporations Canada or the relevant state authority)?
When was the business legally formed?
In which state or province is your business incorporated (e.g., Ontario, British Columbia, or U.S. state)?
What is your principal place of business or registered address?
Is your entity structured as a corporation, limited liability company (LLC), partnership, or another form?
Ownership & Management:
Who are the directors and senior officers? Please include full legal names, dates of birth, and contact details.
Which individuals directly or indirectly own 25% or more of the business? Please provide supporting documentation.
Who is authorized to sign legally binding documents on behalf of the business, and how is their authority documented?
Official Documentation:
Can you provide the official document(s) that confirm your business registration and legal status?
Is your business current and in good standing with the regulatory body?
What additional licenses or permits do you hold that relate to your business activities?
Financial & Operational:
What is your tax ID (e.g., EIN in the U.S. or CRA Business Number in Canada)?
Can you provide recent audited financial statements or other financial documentation that demonstrates your business's financial health?
Do you have documented policies for data protection, cybersecurity (especially for API security related to OpenBanking), and business continuity plans?
Compliance & Risk:
Has your business ever been flagged on sanctions or adverse media watchlists?
Do you have any recent third-party due diligence or risk assessment reports that can verify your compliance?
These questions are now implemented in the form with tooltips for any parenthetical examples, and the questions are displayed with improved formatting and visual hierarchy.

okay now tell me again but in a table:
form label, form label question, concise revision, tooltip info

where ther concise revision, is your intepretation of a more concise version of the question; removing any i.e., e.g., text and instead having that in the tooltip info column.

Do for all fields of the kyb form
