Build a radial network visualization where the center node is the company currently logged into Invela (e.g. “Invela”, “Summit Bank”, etc.).

Connected nodes represent all other companies from the dataset (from companies.json) that have any kind of known relationship (you can infer connection via key_clients_partners, investors, or simply include all other companies for now).

Each outer node should be styled to visually communicate risk and accreditation status:
	•	Node color reflects risk_score using a 5-tier color scale:
	•	Very Low (<200): Green
	•	Low (200–399): Light Green
	•	Medium (400–699): Yellow
	•	High (700–999): Orange
	•	Very High (1000+): Red
	•	Node border or icon should reflect accreditation_status:
	•	APPROVED: checkmark or green outline
	•	AWAITING_INVITATION: grey dashed outline
	•	PENDING: blue dot or pulse
	•	Node size can be uniform or based on revenue_tier (e.g. small = 10px, xlarge = 30px)

Edges (lines between center and outer nodes):
	•	Thickness can be uniform or based on a placeholder metric like risk_score delta
	•	Tooltips on hover should show:
	•	Company name
	•	Risk score + bucket
	•	Accreditation status
	•	Optional: funding stage or category

⸻

⚙️ Functionality:
	•	Show a filter toggle (dropdown or buttons) for:
	•	Risk buckets (e.g. show only High/Very High)
	•	Accreditation status
	•	Category (e.g. FinTech only)
	•	On hover, show a tooltip with basic info
	•	On click, allow expansion (or modal drawer) to view full company profile

🧱 Inputs / Data Fields Used:

From each company in companies.json, use:
	•	name — label
	•	risk_score — to determine color + tooltip
	•	accreditation_status — to style node or tooltip
	•	category — for optional filtering
	•	revenue_tier — to size node
	•	key_clients_partners — optional future support for building true connections

⸻

🖼️ Suggested Visuals:
	•	Center node = large blue/neutral node
	•	Outer ring of companies, colored by risk
	•	Subtle curved lines with relationship pulse animation (optional)
	•	Clean, minimal UI consistent with Invela’s design (neutral backgrounds, soft edges, readable labels)

Let me know if you’d like this converted into an actual code scaffold in React/Svelte or handed off to Figma AI or Replit’s in-house widget builder — I can help format it however is most useful.
