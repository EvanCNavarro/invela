You're right to keep us anchored to the original goal. Here's the Updated Phased Implementation Plan that integrates the multi-layer verification strategy with our WebSocket unification objective:

Revised Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Safe Verification & Critical Assessment (Investigation + Risk Mitigation)
Static Build Analysis - Run webpack/vite analyzer to identify files actually bundled in production
Runtime Dependency Mapping - Check server logs and browser DevTools for actively loaded modules
Critical Path Identification - Map files essential to: authentication, task management, real-time updates
Quarantine Strategy Setup - Create backup branch and quarantine folder for suspected dead files
Phase 2: Verified Critical Path Migration (High Impact + Verified Safe)
Main.tsx cleanup - Remove dual initialization (already partially done)
Compilation error resolution - Fix broken imports causing TypeScript hang
Core component migration - Update WebSocket playground and task center (verified active files only)
Server-side redundancy cleanup - Remove duplicate broadcast functions after verification
Phase 3: Systematic Dead Code Removal (Medium Impact + Gradual)
Move suspected dead files to quarantine - Based on Phase 1 analysis
Test application thoroughly - Run all major flows for 24-48 hours
Consolidate remaining ping/pong implementations (53 â†’ 1) - Only after verification
Update import statements - Fix references to moved/removed files
Phase 4: Final Migration & Validation (Quality Assurance)
Migrate verified active files to unified approach
Connection count verification - Achieve true 1 client per session
Coding standards compliance - Apply docs/CONTRIBUTING.md standards
Documentation updates - Update architecture docs
Key Change: We now verify before touching anything and use quarantine instead of deletion until we're 100% certain files are truly dead code.

Should I start with Phase 1 - running the static build analysis to see which of the 147 WebSocket files are actually included in the production bundle?
