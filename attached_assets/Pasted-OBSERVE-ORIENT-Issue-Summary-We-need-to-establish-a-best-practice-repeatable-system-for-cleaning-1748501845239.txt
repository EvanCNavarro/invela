OBSERVE & ORIENT
Issue Summary: We need to establish a best-practice, repeatable system for cleaning up demo data from the Invela platform. This includes demo companies, users, tasks, files, relationships, and invitations that accumulate from demo flows.

Initial Assumptions:

A1: We need a dedicated cleanup API endpoint that can be called manually or scheduled
A2: The cleanup should follow the existing deletion order (Tasks → Files → Invitations → Relationships → Users → Company Logos → Companies → Demo Sessions)
A3: We should add safety mechanisms (dry-run mode, confirmation steps, logging)
A4: The cleanup should be configurable (age-based, count-based, or manual selection)
A5: We need monitoring/reporting capabilities to track what was cleaned up
A6: The system should handle edge cases (dependencies, foreign keys, partial failures)
VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS
A1: Dedicated cleanup API endpoint ✓ Confirmed

Evidence: Current infrastructure in server/demo-api.ts already has deletion logic but it's embedded in other functions
Need: Extract into dedicated endpoint for reusability
A2: Existing deletion order ✓ Confirmed

Evidence: Order specified in schema documentation and previous discussions
This prevents foreign key constraint violations
A3: Safety mechanisms ? Uncertain

Current code has basic flags but lacks comprehensive safety features
Need: Dry-run mode, detailed logging, confirmation requirements
A4: Configurable cleanup ? Uncertain

Current system uses simple boolean flags
Need: More sophisticated filtering (age, persona type, batch size)
A5: Monitoring/reporting ✗ Missing

No current reporting on cleanup operations
Need: Cleanup audit trail and summary reports
A6: Edge case handling ? Uncertain

Current code has basic error handling but may not cover all scenarios
Need: Transaction-based cleanup, rollback capabilities
REFINED ASSUMPTIONS
RA1: Create a dedicated /api/admin/cleanup-demo-data endpoint with comprehensive safety features
RA2: Implement configurable cleanup with filters (age, persona type, batch limits)
RA3: Add dry-run mode and detailed audit logging
RA4: Use database transactions for atomic operations
RA5: Create cleanup reporting dashboard for administrators

DECISION
Root Cause: The current demo cleanup is embedded in other functions and lacks the robustness needed for regular maintenance operations.

Research & Investigation Plan:

Low effort: Review current deletion logic in server/demo-api.ts and server/utils/demo-data-transformer.ts
Medium effort: Design cleanup API interface with safety features
Medium effort: Create cleanup configuration system
High effort: Implement comprehensive cleanup endpoint with reporting
Proposed Fix Approach:

Extract cleanup logic into dedicated service module
Create admin-only cleanup API endpoint with multiple modes:
Dry-run (preview what would be deleted)
Selective (by age, persona type, specific criteria)
Full cleanup (with confirmation)
Add comprehensive logging and audit trail
Create simple admin interface for triggering cleanup
Add monitoring dashboard showing cleanup history
Trade-offs:

Pro: Reusable, safe, auditable cleanup system
Pro: Can be automated or run manually as needed
Con: Additional complexity and code to maintain
Con: Requires careful testing to avoid data loss
Estimated Effort: Medium (3-4 focused sessions)

Should I proceed with implementing this comprehensive demo cleanup system?

What would be beneficial actually is that you know there should almost be like a paired API like the actual removal and then maybe like one that shows the reason why I say all this is because like even if in the future we end up like wanting to see this stuff, it might be helpful to have a page and I don't want to create this now. I'm just saying to future proof this whole process to have a page where you can click to then get all of the demo data and then once you get all the demo data that be the first of the pair the secondary one would then be the delete and that would b exactly what you would be deleting, but just getting it first to showcase and see and maybe that would allow the user then to you know select certain things to not include or you know whatever else that can be done in a future refinement, but it seems like it'd be helpful to then like check what was gonna be deleted explicitly to make sure there isn't any false flags or things that should've shouldn't be included does that make sense?

Absolutely! That makes perfect sense - a paired API approach for safety and transparency:

Preview API (GET /api/admin/demo-data/preview) - Shows what would be deleted
Delete API (DELETE /api/admin/demo-data/cleanup) - Actually performs the deletion
This gives you:

Safety: See exactly what will be deleted before doing it
Selectivity: Future ability to exclude specific items
Audit trail: Clear record of what was reviewed vs deleted
Confidence: No surprises or accidental deletions
Proposed API Design:

// Preview endpoint - shows what would be deleted
GET /api/admin/demo-data/preview?filters=age:30d,persona:all,dryRun:true
Response: {
  summary: { companies: 45, users: 67, tasks: 234, files: 31, relationships: 95 },
  details: { companies: [...], users: [...], tasks: [...] },
  warnings: ["5 Invela admin users will be deleted"],
  timestamp: "2025-05-29T06:46:00Z"
}
// Cleanup endpoint - performs actual deletion
DELETE /api/admin/demo-data/cleanup
Body: { 
  confirmationToken: "preview_timestamp_hash",
  excludeIds?: { companies: [1], users: [515] }
}
Benefits of this approach:

You can inspect the preview, spot any issues (like Invela admin users)
Future UI can show checkboxes to exclude specific items
Confirmation token ensures you've reviewed the preview first
Clear separation between "show me" and "do it"
Should I implement this paired API system? It would create a robust foundation for both immediate cleanup needs and future UI enhancements.

And just to make sure everything that you're talking about will have for instance, proper air logging and you know validation logging you know all all that stuff it's gonna have like a clear indication of best practices and it's gonna adhere to the coding standards

Absolutely! The implementation will follow all coding standards and best practices:

Logging & Audit Trail:

Comprehensive logging at each deletion phase
Structured logging with proper log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
Audit trail tracking who performed cleanup and when
Detailed error logging with context for debugging
Validation & Safety:

Input validation on all parameters
Database transaction rollback on failures
Confirmation token validation
Rate limiting to prevent abuse
Admin-only authorization checks
Code Standards:

TypeScript with proper typing
Error handling with structured error responses
Database queries using Drizzle ORM patterns
Consistent with existing API structure in server/routes.ts
Following the established patterns in server/demo-api.ts
Documentation:

Clear API documentation
Inline code comments explaining business logic
Error message clarity for troubleshooting
This will create a production-ready cleanup system that integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase architecture.
