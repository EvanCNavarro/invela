- This task will be called "Compliance And Risk Documentation (CARD) Task".
- The goal of this task is for the user to provide documentation on their associated company's security certification.
- - The user can provide this documentation by either selecting to upload specifically defined files, or by answering a very long set of questions. (The set of questions is long to incentivize the user to quickly upload files; because we trust the files more than manually entered, user-error-prone form data)
- Within the task, the system will take the uploaded files and process them (processing the file using AI to scan the file, and gain insight on the document) and will use the insights of the document processing to answer the same long list of questions that the user could have alternatively filled out manually. Ultimately, the task, after work done by the user to either upload documents or manually fill out a form, will result in a filled out set of questions/answers about the company's security certifications. (The difference is the document upload will not show the questions and will just instead be a file upload view, vs. the long question route which will be a form)
- Each question will have an associated risk score, such that if a question is blank it will be riskier (and will get a higher score), if a question is answered and the answer suffices to match the wanted answer then it is less risky (low score). At the end of the form the risk score will be tallied, as a cummulative score of all the individual risk score values.
- The form's final risk score will be a value of 0-1500, which will be the risk score that is assigned to the company.
- The flow of the user moving through the task will be as follows: (not started) the user is assigned the task, the user opens the task, the user chooses to either upload documents or answer a long set of questions (in progress), the user either uploads documents or answers all the questions (ready for submission), the user then submits the task, upon submission of the form (submitted): 1. the associated company is assigned the risk score  2. the status of the task changes to submitted 3. the task is no longer workable so when the user clicks the task it just shows details 4. the 'dashboard' and 'insights' tabs are unlocked, by adding them to the available_tabs for the company 5. a modal similar (but with different text) to the modal that appears after the kyb task shows up; information the user that they unlocked the insights tab and dashboard page 6. the onboarding_company_completed for the company is set to true
- other notables is that this task will most likely need the same logic for saving the form fields and repopulating them as the 'kyb task' -- and will also need the same database table logic for the fields and responses but for 'accreditation'
- another notable is that any file uploaded through this task, those files should be also visible in the file center after being uploaded to the task/system.
