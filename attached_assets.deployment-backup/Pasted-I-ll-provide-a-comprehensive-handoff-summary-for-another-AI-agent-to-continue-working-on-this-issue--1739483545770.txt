I'll provide a comprehensive handoff summary for another AI agent to continue working on this issue:

Issue Overview:

Email invitations are failing for user invites but working for fintech invites
The root cause is a mismatch between data structures and transformations in the invitation flows
Technical Details:

Template Schema Requirements (from templates.ts):
invitationTemplateSchema = z.object({
  recipientName: z.string(),
  recipientEmail: z.string().email(),
  senderName: z.string(),
  senderCompany: z.string(),
  targetCompany: z.string(),
  inviteUrl: z.string().url(),
  code: z.string().optional()
});
Current Data Flow Issues:
Frontend (InviteModal.tsx):

Both user and fintech invites use same modal but different endpoints
User invites were adding extra fields (recipientEmail, senderCompany, targetCompany)
Attempted fix: Unified payload structure for both types
Backend (routes/users.ts):

User invite route does additional data transformation
Email template data construction differs from working fintech flow
Template validation fails due to missing required fields
Failed Attempts:

Fixing backend template data structure:
const emailTemplateData = {
  recipientName: data.full_name,
  recipientEmail: data.email.toLowerCase(),
  senderName: data.sender_name,
  senderCompany: company.name,
  targetCompany: company.name,
  inviteUrl,
  code: invitationCode
};
Removing frontend data transformation in InviteModal.tsx:
const payload = {
  email: formData.email.toLowerCase().trim(),
  full_name: formData.full_name.trim(),
  company_name: formData.company_name.trim(),
  sender_name: user?.fullName,
  company_id: companyId || 0
};
Next Steps for New Agent:

Compare working fintech invite route with user invite route
Ensure both routes construct identical email template data
Remove any unnecessary data transformations
Verify template validation passes in both flows
Add comprehensive logging to track data structure at each step
