Define to me: what you're going to change, what you expect the changes to result in, and then how we can test after wards and see if the changes worked.

Then make sure you add code comments, and util logger messages, for you to check and keep track of the actions that take place and the results.

Implementation Plan: KY3P Form Standardization
1. What I'm Going to Change
Create a new enhanced KY3P form service that uses the standardized batch update approach

Located at: client/src/services/enhanced-ky3p-form-service.ts
Extends the existing KY3P form service but overrides the problematic bulkUpdate method
Modify the universal form component's KY3P handling

Ensure it uses the enhanced service for KY3P forms
Update import paths and declarations
Add thorough logging to track the data flow and diagnose issues

2. Expected Results
Demo auto-fill will work for KY3P forms similar to KYB and Open Banking

No more "Invalid field ID format" errors
Fields will populate immediately with demo data
Clear Fields functionality will navigate correctly

Form will navigate to the first section after clearing
Will prevent the navigation timing issue that's occurring now
Consistent behavior across all form types

All three form types (KYB, KY3P, Open Banking) will use the same approach
String-based field keys will be used consistently throughout the system
3. Testing Plan
Demo Auto-fill Test:

Navigate to a KY3P task form (e.g., task ID 662)
Click the "Demo Auto-fill" button
Expected: Form should populate with demo data with no errors
Verify: Check console logs for our debug messages confirming the data format
Clear Fields Navigation Test:

After populating the form, click "Clear Fields"
Expected: Form should clear AND navigate to the first section/tab
Verify: Check that form returns to section 1 and fields are cleared
Bulk Update Test:

Make changes to multiple fields in different sections
Click "Save Progress"
Expected: All changes should save successfully
Verify: Check console logs showing proper format used for batch update
4. Implementation Details
Let's proceed with the implementation:
