Database structure concern: You've identified an important issue about the kyb_responses table potentially lacking a primary key. Let's check the database schema to confirm this:

Check the database schema to confirm this.

Also, you might have shown the /diagnostic form correctly, but don't forget we need to make sure that the form is working for the actual application /task-center/task/348 so figure out the next steps and a reminder that we were planning to work on the following:

Plan for Comprehensive Improvement
Here's my plan to address these issues comprehensively:
1. Fix Core Data Management
First, we need to ensure data loads correctly and stays consistent:
Simplify Data Loading: Revise the form data loading process to ensure it always gets fresh data on initial load and after each update
Implement Cleaner State Management: Consider using more direct state management rather than complex caching
Fix Form Initialization: Ensure data loads consistently on first form render
2. Improve Field Tracking and Progress Calculation
Simplify Field Status Detection: Create a clearer, more robust way to determine if a field is filled
Fix Section Completion Logic: Rewrite the logic to properly mark sections as complete when all fields are filled
Update Progress Calculations: Revise how overall form progress is calculated to accurately reflect completion
3. Enhance Form Architecture
Streamline Data Flow: Establish a clearer flow of data through the application
Remove Over-optimization: Strip away excessive caching and throttling that might be causing issues
Standardize API Interactions: Create a consistent pattern for saving and loading form data
Implementation Strategy
I'd approach this in phases:
Phase 1: Fix Immediate Issues
Fix the section completion display
Ensure data loads correctly on form initialization
Fix progress percentage calculation
Phase 2: Improve Core Architecture
Simplify data flow
Reduce unnecessary optimization
Establish clearer patterns for field and section status tracking
Phase 3: Enhance User Experience
Add better loading states
Improve error handling
Optimize for performance with simpler, more reliable code
