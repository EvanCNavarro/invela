We implement robust access controls through role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring users can only access resources necessary for their role. All user logins require multi-factor authentication (MFA), and administrative privileges are tightly restricted. Additionally, we apply strict firewall rules and network segmentation to limit unauthorized lateral movement and external access. Access logs are continuously monitored and reviewed to detect and respond to any suspicious activity.
