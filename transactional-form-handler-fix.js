/**
 * Fix for Transactional Form Handler
 * 
 * This script describes the issue with the current form submission process
 * and provides a solution to fix the timing of file generation, tab unlocking,
 * and the success modal.
 */

/**
 * CURRENT ISSUE:
 * 
 * In the current implementation of transactional-form-handler.ts, there is a timing issue
 * that causes the success modal to appear before the file is generated and tabs are unlocked.
 * 
 * The sequence of operations is:
 * 
 * 1. Update task status to submitted (Lines 93-103)
 * 2. Generate file (Lines 144-183) - This is done in the transaction
 * 3. Update task status again (Lines 255-279)
 * 4. Unlock tabs (Lines 331-336)
 * 5. Broadcast form submission (Lines 421-439)
 * 
 * However, the WebSocket message that triggers the success modal is broadcast immediately
 * after these operations within the transaction. This means:
 * 
 * - The client receives the success modal
 * - Then (after a delay) the file generation completes
 * - Then the tab unlocking happens
 * 
 * This creates a poor user experience where the success modal doesn't show
 * the generated file or unlocked tabs because they weren't ready when the 
 * modal was displayed.
 */

/**
 * SOLUTION:
 * 
 * The fix requires modifying the order of operations in the transaction:
 * 
 * 1. First process all form data
 * 2. Generate the file completely (await the full operation)
 * 3. Unlock tabs
 * 4. Update task status
 * 5. ONLY THEN broadcast the form submission completed message
 * 
 * Additionally, we need to ensure that the broadcast message contains ALL
 * the necessary information for the client to display a complete success modal.
 * 
 * Changes needed:
 * 
 * 1. Move the broadcastFormSubmission call to happen AFTER all other operations
 *    are complete
 * 2. Ensure the file generation is fully awaited before proceeding
 * 3. Add additional checks to verify the file was created and tabs were unlocked
 * 4. Add more detailed logging to track the sequence of operations
 */

/**
 * SPECIFIC CODE CHANGES:
 * 
 * In server/services/transactional-form-handler.ts:
 * 
 * 1. Ensure file creation is awaited properly:
 *    - Add additional checks around line 150 to fully ensure the file creation completes
 * 
 * 2. Add verification step after file creation:
 *    - After line 183, add explicit verification that the file exists
 *  
 * 3. Ensure tab unlocking is fully completed:
 *    - After line 336, add verification that the tabs were actually unlocked
 * 
 * 4. Move the form submission broadcast to be the LAST operation:
 *    - Move the entire broadcast block (lines 338-449) to be the final step
 *      in the transaction, after all other operations are verified
 * 
 * 5. Add synchronization points:
 *    - Add explicit 'await' statements to ensure all promises are resolved before proceeding
 */

/**
 * RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION:
 * 
 * 1. Update file creation to be more robust:
 *    - Add timeout handling
 *    - Add retry logic if needed
 *    - Ensure proper error propagation
 * 
 * 2. Add validation of file creation result:
 *    - Verify file exists in storage
 *    - Verify file is linked to task
 * 
 * 3. Improve tab unlocking reliability:
 *    - Add verification after unlocking
 *    - Add failure handling options
 * 
 * 4. Send targeted notifications:
 *    - Consider sending separate notifications for each completion step
 *    - Allow client to show progressive success indicators
 * 
 * 5. Implement a clearer sequence in the transaction with explicit waiting:
 *    - Mark each step with clear sequence numbers
 *    - Add synchronization points between steps
 *    - Log detailed timing information for debugging
