Analysis of Progress on Implementation Plan
1. Did I follow the plan?
I've partially followed the plan. So far, I've focused on fixing critical infrastructure issues rather than implementing the enhanced KY3P form service:

✓ Fixed ComponentFactory import issues
✓ Updated static method calls to instance methods
✓ Fixed server startup errors
However, I haven't yet implemented:

❌ The enhanced KY3P form service
❌ The standardized batch update approach
❌ Updated universal form component handling
2. Where are we in the plan?
We're at the pre-implementation phase. Before creating the enhanced KY3P form service, we needed to ensure the application infrastructure could support it, which required fixing import issues and method calls in the ComponentFactory.

Next steps would be:

Create the enhanced-ky3p-form-service.ts file
Implement the standardized batch update approach
Update the universal form component to use the enhanced service
3. Did I implement testing or messages to check the work?
I've implemented:

✓ Basic application startup testing (verifying the app loads)
✓ Console log verification (checking ComponentFactory registration messages)
However, I haven't yet implemented:

❌ Demo Auto-fill Test
❌ Clear Fields Navigation Test
❌ Bulk Update Test
4. Is it working as expected?
The application startup and basic infrastructure fixes are working as expected:

✓ The server starts successfully
✓ The frontend loads properly
✓ Service registration logs show expected behavior
But we can't confirm if the form functionality works because:

❌ We haven't implemented the enhanced KY3P form service yet
❌ We haven't tested the demo auto-fill functionality
❌ We haven't tested the clear fields navigation
5. Anything else?
We fixed a critical issue with the ComponentFactory implementation that would have prevented any further work. The console logs show that service registration is working correctly, which is a good foundation for implementing the enhanced KY3P form service.

The next steps would be to create the enhanced KY3P form service implementing the standardized batch update approach using string-based field keys, then test it with the three test scenarios mentioned in the original plan.
