Don't edit code, we're still planning.

Okay, some refinements that are worth noting for you to check and update:

----
Step 1: Document Upload
UI/UX Components:
- The header showing "Upload DataTechCompany's Compliance Documentation" has the company name of the company that the CARD task is for where the company name in this case is DataTechCompany.
- The drag and drop zone is shown as a specific area, but the user can drag and drop to the entire page. And I think the fileuploadplayground component has this option available
- Also include a count for the other boxes (I just realized there an instance where the user might uploaded multiple soc 2 reports for instance)
- Correct with the next button.

States:
- correct and reference the screenshots to add specific notes on this. Good job.

Required Functions:
- correct.
----
Step 2: Processing
UI/UX Components:
- I would rearrange that order since the processing status shows up before the file name as shown in the screenshot, where finished-processed files show a greencheckmark, processing shows the invela loading spinner of a similar size, and the pending-to-be-processed items have a grey circle, and then also the failed-unprocessed items would have a red-filled-circle-x. Then the name. Then the file size. Then a changing state of processedfiles=count of answers found in green text, processing="(Searching for Answers...)" grey text, then the pending items would have a blank value, and the failed-unprocessed items would have red text "Processing Failed". (That's 4 items in the row; ProcessState, FileName, FileSize, ProcessResult)
- Correct with the buttons.
- Don't forget about the hover time estimate on the currently processing file.

States:
- Correct.

Required Functions:
- Correct.

----
Step 3: Review & Transition
UI/UX Components:
- Yes total count of the unique answers, because we're doing the logic beforehand in the previous step, so if there's 90 questions, it would be impossible to have 95 answers for instance.
- Yes, so that requires us to get the total amount of questions from the database, then subtract the found answers and use that as the 'remaining questions' value.
- Correct.
- Also note in the screenshot i have the same green filled circle check mark shown above the text in the result content box, so emphasize things were successful.

States:
- Correct.

Required Functions:
- Seems correct, but I'd check how the cardformplayground component is already handling these autofill things, i bleive the form just checks the database for what answers already exist. So that might reduce the functions you've listed there.
