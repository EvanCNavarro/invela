# Recent Development Fixes & Updates

## FileVault Authentication & Display Resolution
**Date**: 2025-06-06  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Version**: 2.0.1

### Problem Summary
FileVault functionality was broken with multiple critical issues:
- Files not displaying in the frontend despite successful server uploads
- User authentication failures preventing file queries
- Module resolution conflicts causing upload failures
- Circular dependency in query logic

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Module Resolution Conflict**: Duplicate toast hook file causing upload failures
2. **Wrong User Hook Import**: FileVault importing `use-user.ts` (queries non-existent `/api/auth/user`) instead of `useUser.ts` (queries working `/api/user`)
3. **Circular Query Dependency**: FileVault query required `user?.company_id` but couldn't get user data due to wrong hook
4. **Authentication Flow Issues**: Session data not properly passed through deserializeUser function

### Technical Resolution
1. **Fixed Hook Import**: Changed FileVault from `@/hooks/use-user` to `@/hooks/useUser`
2. **Enhanced Server Logging**: Added detailed authentication debugging to `/api/user` endpoint
3. **Verified API Response**: Confirmed `/api/user` returns complete user object with `company_id: 780`
4. **Removed Module Conflicts**: Eliminated duplicate toast hook causing build issues

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken)
import { useUser } from "@/hooks/use-user"; // queries /api/auth/user (doesn't exist)

// AFTER (working)
import { useUser } from "@/hooks/useUser"; // queries /api/user (working endpoint)
```

### Verification Results
- ✅ User authentication working (company_id: 780)
- ✅ File list displaying 4 uploaded files
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket updates for new uploads
- ✅ Database queries executing successfully
- ✅ Files being retrieved and displayed properly

### Server Logs Confirmation
```
[Files] ✅ Query returned 4 files {
  recordCount: 4,
  totalFiles: 4,
  page: 1,
  pageSize: 5,
  fileIds: [ 1044, 1043, 1042, 1041 ],
  company: { id: 780, name: undefined },
  timestamp: '2025-06-06T09:45:24.331Z'
}
```

### Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/FileVault.tsx` - Fixed user hook import
- `server/auth.ts` - Enhanced authentication logging
- `client/src/components/modals/ChangelogModal.tsx` - Added changelog entry

### Impact
FileVault is now fully functional with proper file upload, display, and management capabilities restored. Users can successfully upload files and see their file lists with real-time updates.
