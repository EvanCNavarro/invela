# Task Status Preservation Fix

## Problem
When running the `unlockAllTasks` function in `task-dependencies.ts`, tasks that were previously marked as "submitted" were being reset to "not_started", causing a regression in task status tracking.

## Root Cause
The `unlockAllTasks` function wasn't properly checking for submission indicators in task metadata before updating task status. This caused submitted tasks to be reverted to their default status during dependency unlocking operations.

## Solution
We implemented a comprehensive filter in the `unlockAllTasks` function that checks for multiple submission indicators before processing a task:

1. Presence of submission date in metadata:
   - `submissionDate`
   - `submittedAt`
   - `submission_date`

2. Presence of submission flag in metadata:
   - `submitted: true`
   - `isSubmitted: true`

3. Presence of file ID in metadata (indicating file generation from submission):
   - `fileId`
   - `file_id`

4. Task status explicitly set to "submitted"

If any of these indicators are present, the task is excluded from the unlocking process, preserving its submitted state.

## Additional Improvements
1. Added detailed logging of skipped tasks with submission indicators
2. Added a flag to identify KY3P tasks for special handling
3. Created a test API endpoint for verification of submission state preservation
4. Implemented a test script to validate the fix works correctly

## Verification
The fix has been verified using a test script that:
1. Creates a test task submission state
2. Calls the `unlockAllTasks` function 
3. Verifies the submission state is preserved after unlocking

The test confirms that submitted tasks maintain their:
- "submitted" status
- 100% progress
- Submission flags in metadata
- Submission dates in metadata

## Files Modified
- server/routes/task-dependencies.ts - Added filtering logic to protect submitted tasks
- server/routes/test-submission-state.ts - Added test endpoints for verification
- server/routes.ts - Registered the test submission state router

## Conclusion
This fix ensures that form submission status is properly preserved during task dependency operations, maintaining data integrity and user experience.
