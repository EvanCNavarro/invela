# Task Status Preservation Fix

## Problem
Two issues were identified in the task status tracking:

1. When running the `unlockAllTasks` function in `task-dependencies.ts`, tasks that were previously marked as "submitted" were being reset to "not_started", causing a regression in task status tracking.

2. New User Invitation tasks (task_type = 'user_onboarding') were not being marked as "completed" after users successfully logged in for the first time.

## Root Cause
1. The `unlockAllTasks` function wasn't properly checking for submission indicators in task metadata before updating task status. This caused submitted tasks to be reverted to their default status during dependency unlocking operations.

2. User onboarding tasks had no special handling to mark them as completed when a user successfully registered and logged in.

## Solution

### 1. Form Submission Status Preservation
We implemented a comprehensive filter in the `unlockAllTasks` function that checks for multiple submission indicators before processing a task:

- Presence of submission date in metadata:
  - `submissionDate`
  - `submittedAt`
  - `submission_date`

- Presence of submission flag in metadata:
  - `submitted: true`
  - `isSubmitted: true`

- Presence of file ID in metadata (indicating file generation from submission):
  - `fileId`
  - `file_id`

- Task status explicitly set to "submitted"

If any of these indicators are present, the task is excluded from the unlocking process, preserving its submitted state.

### 2. User Onboarding Task Completion
We added special handling for user onboarding tasks (New User Invitation) to mark them as completed with 100% progress when users log in:

1. Identify tasks of type 'user_onboarding' and process them differently
2. Directly update these tasks in the database with status="completed" and progress=100%
3. Add submission metadata to ensure they're flagged as completed
4. Broadcast the update via WebSocket to notify clients

## Additional Improvements
1. Added detailed logging of skipped tasks with submission indicators
2. Added flags to identify special task types (KY3P, User Onboarding) for proper handling
3. Created a test API endpoint for verification of submission state preservation
4. Implemented a test script to validate the fix works correctly
5. Added documentation for all changes

## Verification
The fix has been verified using a test script that:
1. Creates a test task submission state
2. Calls the `unlockAllTasks` function 
3. Verifies the submission state is preserved after unlocking

The test confirms that submitted tasks maintain their:
- "submitted" status
- 100% progress
- Submission flags in metadata
- Submission dates in metadata

Additionally, user onboarding tasks are now properly marked as "completed" with 100% progress.

## Files Modified
- server/routes/task-dependencies.ts 
  - Added filtering logic to protect submitted tasks
  - Added special handling for user onboarding tasks
- server/routes/test-submission-state.ts - Added test endpoints for verification
- server/routes.ts - Registered the test submission state router

## Conclusion
This fix ensures that form submission status is properly preserved during task dependency operations, and user onboarding tasks are correctly marked as completed, maintaining data integrity and improving user experience.
