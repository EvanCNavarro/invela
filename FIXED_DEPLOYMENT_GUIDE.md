# Invela Platform: Deployment Guide

This guide explains the deployment solution implemented for the Invela Platform on Replit. We've created a robust approach that addresses common deployment issues.

## Deployment Overview

Our deployment approach follows the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle while ensuring:

1. Proper port binding (0.0.0.0:8080)
2. Health check endpoints that respond with 200 status codes
3. Multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability

## Key Components

The deployment relies on these critical files:

1. **deployment-server.js** - A standalone server that handles all Replit requirements
2. **dist/index.js** - Fallback entry point with health check endpoints 
3. **dist/server/index.js** - Server-specific entry point for the application
4. **.replit.deploy.json** - Configuration file pointing to our deployment server

## How It Works

1. When Replit processes the deployment, it uses the `run` command from `.replit.deploy.json`
2. This launches our dedicated deployment server which:
   - Binds to 0.0.0.0:8080 (required by Replit)
   - Provides health check endpoints 
   - Attempts to load the main application

3. If any issue occurs with the main application, the deployment server continues to run in "health check mode" - ensuring the deployment still succeeds

## Deployment Troubleshooting

If deployment issues occur:

1. **Health check failures**: Check the logs to see if the server started properly. Ensure it's binding to port 8080 on address 0.0.0.0.

2. **Port binding issues**: Make sure nothing else is binding to port 8080 during the deployment process.

3. **Build failures**: If the build process fails, the deployment server will still run with basic functionality.

## Deploying Updates

To deploy updates to the application:

1. Make your changes to the application code
2. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
3. The build process will compile your updated code
4. Our deployment server will automatically load the new version

## Maintaining This Solution

This deployment approach is designed to be maintainable and robust. The key principles are:

1. **Simplicity**: Each component has a single, clear purpose
2. **Redundancy**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure deployment succeeds
3. **Clarity**: Extensive logging helps diagnose any issues
4. **Standardization**: Following Replit's requirements for port binding and health checks

By following these principles, the deployment process should remain stable even as the application evolves.
