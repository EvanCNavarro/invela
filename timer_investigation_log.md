# Timer Investigation Log
## Persistent 60-Second Timer Elimination

**Problem:** Timer continues firing every 60 seconds despite BatchUpdateManager modifications
**Pattern:** 09:47:31 â†’ 09:48:31 (exactly 60 seconds)
**Source:** KY3P form page (/task-center/task/1103)

## Files Investigated âœ“
- `client/src/utils/form-optimization.ts` - Found and disabled BatchUpdateManagerImpl timer, but pattern persists
- `client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx` - Only has gcTime: 60000 (garbage collection, not timer)
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - Various refetchInterval configs, but none at 60s

## Search Results Analyzed âœ“
- `grep "new BatchUpdateManager"` - Found 2 instances, disabled automatic timer creation
- `grep "60000\|60\*1000"` in hooks - Only found auth garbage collection
- `grep "refetchInterval\|staleTime.*60"` - Found various intervals but none matching pattern
- `grep "setInterval\|setTimeout" in forms` - Found timeouts but none at 60s (800ms, 150ms, 50ms, 5s)
- `grep "FormBatchUpdater"` - Found singleton usage in use-form-data-manager.ts hook

## Current Hypotheses ðŸ¤”
1. **React useEffect with setInterval** - Form component creating 60s timer (most likely)
2. **Multiple BatchUpdateManager instances** - New instances created after page loads
3. **React Query auto-refetch** - Hidden configuration triggering updates
4. **WebSocket heartbeat/reconnection** - Triggering form sync every 60s

## Files to Investigate Next ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Search for React useEffect hooks in form components
- [x] Check KY3P form components for timer creation - Found standardized-ky3p-update.ts (API endpoint)
- [ ] Look for auto-save or sync mechanisms  
- [ ] Investigate form data managers and listeners
- [ ] Check standardized form update components
- [ ] Find the KY3P form component that loads on task page /task-center/task/1103

## Key Insights ðŸ’¡
- Timer starts immediately when KY3P form page loads
- Continues every 60 seconds regardless of user activity
- Calls `/api/ky3p/batch-update/1103` endpoint
- Headers show User-Agent and Referer from form page
- Pattern is too precise to be coincidental - intentional timer somewhere

## Next Actions ðŸŽ¯
1. Search React components for 60-second intervals
2. Find useEffect hooks in form-related files
3. Trace call chain from form components to batch update
4. Identify and disable timer source without breaking functionality
