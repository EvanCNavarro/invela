# Timer Investigation Log
## Persistent 60-Second Timer Elimination

**Problem:** Timer continues firing every 60 seconds despite BatchUpdateManager modifications
**Pattern:** 09:47:31 â†’ 09:48:31 (exactly 60 seconds)
**Source:** KY3P form page (/task-center/task/1103)

## Files Investigated âœ“
- `client/src/utils/form-optimization.ts` - Found and disabled BatchUpdateManagerImpl timer, but pattern persists
- `client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx` - Only has gcTime: 60000 (garbage collection, not timer)
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - Various refetchInterval configs, but none at 60s

## Search Results Analyzed âœ“
- `grep "new BatchUpdateManager"` - Found 2 instances, disabled automatic timer creation
- `grep "60000\|60\*1000"` in hooks - Only found auth garbage collection
- `grep "refetchInterval\|staleTime.*60"` - Found various intervals but none matching pattern
- `grep "setInterval\|setTimeout" in forms` - Found timeouts but none at 60s (800ms, 150ms, 50ms, 5s)
- `grep "FormBatchUpdater"` - Found singleton usage in use-form-data-manager.ts hook
- `grep "auto.*save"` - Found auto-save functionality in StandardizedUniversalForm.tsx
- **CONFIRMED**: Timer fires consistently: 09:51:31 â†’ 09:52:31 â†’ 09:53:31 (exact 60s intervals)
- **SOURCE LOCATION**: KY3P form page `/task-center/task/1103` confirmed by referer header
- **API CALLS FOUND**: Multiple files call `/api/ky3p/batch-update/` endpoint:
  - `fix-ky3p-bulk-update.ts` - Manual call function
  - `standardized-ky3p-update.ts` - Standardized update function  
  - `enhanced-ky3p-form-service.ts` - Service with timer disabled but calls endpoint

## UNVALIDATED Hypotheses - Need Proof ðŸ¤”
1. **Assumption**: React component creating timer - NO EVIDENCE YET
2. **Assumption**: 60-second interval - PATTERN OBSERVED but SOURCE UNKNOWN  
3. **Assumption**: BatchUpdateManager disabled - CHANGES MADE but TIMER PERSISTS
4. **Assumption**: Timer on KY3P form page - REFERER SUGGESTS but NOT CONFIRMED

## Evidence Required
- [ ] Actual timer source identification via stack trace
- [ ] Validation of exact interval timing 
- [ ] Proof of component/service creating timer
- [ ] Elimination of other potential sources

## Files to Investigate Next ðŸ“‹

**High Priority - Need to Check for Timer Creation:**
- [ ] `client/src/components/forms/UniversalFormNew.tsx` - Main form component loaded on KY3P page
- [ ] `client/src/hooks/form/use-form-data-manager.ts` - Form hook with BatchUpdater usage
- [ ] `client/src/components/forms/standardized-ky3p-update.ts` - Makes batch-update calls
- [ ] `client/src/services/unified-ky3p-form-service.ts` - Service layer

**React Query Sources to Check:**
- [ ] Check if any React Query has `refetchInterval: 60000` specifically for KY3P

**Pattern Tracking:**
- 09:51:31 âœ“
- 09:52:31 âœ“ 
- 09:53:31 âœ“
- 09:54:31 âœ“ (JUST FIRED)

## Key Insights ðŸ’¡
- Timer starts immediately when KY3P form page loads
- Continues every 60 seconds regardless of user activity
- Calls `/api/ky3p/batch-update/1103` endpoint
- Headers show User-Agent and Referer from form page
- Pattern is too precise to be coincidental - intentional timer somewhere

## Next Actions ðŸŽ¯
1. Search React components for 60-second intervals
2. Find useEffect hooks in form-related files
3. Trace call chain from form components to batch update
4. Identify and disable timer source without breaking functionality
